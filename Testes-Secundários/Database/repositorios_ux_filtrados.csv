Aastha2104/Parkinson-Disease-Prediction,"Introduction  Parkinson’s Disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s, affecting more than 10 million people worldwide. Parkinson’s is characterized primarily by the deterioration of motor and cognitive ability. There is no single test which can be administered for diagnosis. Instead, doctors must perform a careful clinical analysis of the patient’s medical history. Unfortunately, this method of diagnosis is highly inaccurate. A study from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders finds that early diagnosis (having symptoms for 5 years or less) is only 53% accurate. This is not much better than random guessing, but an early diagnosis is critical to effective treatment. Because of these difficulties, I investigate a machine learning approach to accurately diagnose Parkinson’s, using a dataset of various speech features (a non-invasive yet characteristic tool) from the University of Oxford. Why speech features? Speech is very predictive and characteristic of Parkinson’s disease; almost every Parkinson’s patient experiences severe vocal degradation (inability to produce sustained phonations, tremor, hoarseness), so it makes sense to use voice to diagnose the disease. Voice analysis gives the added benefit of being non-invasive, inexpensive, and very easy to extract clinically. Background  Parkinson's Disease  Parkinson’s is a progressive neurodegenerative condition resulting from the death of the dopamine containing cells of the substantia nigra (which plays an important role in movement). Symptoms include: “frozen” facial features, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), akinesia (impairment of voluntary movement), tremor, and voice impairment. Typically, by the time the disease is diagnosed, 60% of nigrostriatal neurons have degenerated, and 80% of striatal dopamine have been depleted. Performance Metrics  TP = true positive, FP = false positive, TN = true negative, FN = false negative Accuracy: (TP+TN)/(P+N) Matthews Correlation Coefficient: 1=perfect, 0=random, -1=completely inaccurate Algorithms Employed  Logistic Regression (LR): Uses the sigmoid logistic equation with weights (coefficient values) and biases (constants) to model the probability of a certain class for binary classification. An output of 1 represents one class, and an output of 0 represents the other. Training the model will learn the optimal weights and biases. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): Assumes that the data is Gaussian and each feature has the same variance. LDA estimates the mean and variance for each class from the training data, and then uses properties of statistics (Bayes theorem , Gaussian distribution, etc) to compute the probability of a particular instance belonging to a given class. The class with the largest probability is the prediction. k Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Makes predictions about the validation set using the entire training set. KNN makes a prediction about a new instance by searching through the entire set to find the k “closest” instances. “Closeness” is determined using a proximity measurement (Euclidean) across all features. The class that the majority of the k closest instances belong to is the class that the model predicts the new instance to be. Decision Tree (DT): Represented by a binary tree, where each root node represents an input variable and a split point, and each leaf node contains an output used to make a prediction. Neural Network (NN): Models the way the human brain makes decisions. Each neuron takes in 1+ inputs, and then uses an activation function to process the input with weights and biases to produce an output. Neurons can be arranged into layers, and multiple layers can form a network to model complex decisions. Training the network involves using the training instances to optimize the weights and biases. Naive Bayes (NB): Simplifies the calculation of probabilities by assuming that all features are independent of one another (a strong but effective assumption). Employs Bayes Theorem to calculate the probabilities that the instance to be predicted is in each class, then finds the class with the highest probability. Gradient Boost (GB): Generally used when seeking a model with very high predictive performance. Used to reduce bias and variance (“error”) by combining multiple “weak learners” (not very good models) to create a “strong learner” (high performance model). Involves 3 elements: a loss function (error function) to be optimized, a weak learner (decision tree) to make predictions, and an additive model to add trees to minimize the loss function. Gradient descent is used to minimize error after adding each tree (one by one). Engineering Goal  Produce a machine learning model to diagnose Parkinson’s disease given various features of a patient’s speech with at least 90% accuracy and/or a Matthews Correlation Coefficient of at least 0.9. Compare various algorithms and parameters to determine the best model for predicting Parkinson’s.  Dataset Description  Source: the University of Oxford 195 instances (147 subjects with Parkinson’s, 48 without Parkinson’s) 22 features (elements that are possibly characteristic of Parkinson’s, such as frequency, pitch, amplitude / period of the sound wave) 1 label (1 for Parkinson’s, 0 for no Parkinson’s) Project Pipeline  pipeline  Summary of Procedure  Split the Oxford Parkinson’s Dataset into two parts: one for training, one for validation (evaluate how well the model performs) Train each of the following algorithms with the training set: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, k Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boost Evaluate results using the validation set Repeat for the following training set to validation set splits: 80% training / 20% validation, 75% / 25%, and 70% / 30% Repeat for a rescaled version of the dataset (scale all the numbers in the dataset to a range from 0 to 1: this helps to reduce the effect of outliers) Conduct 5 trials and average the results Data  a_o  a_r  m_o  m_r  Data Analysis  In general, the models tended to perform the best (both in terms of accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient) on the rescaled dataset with a 75-25 train-test split. The two highest performing algorithms, k Nearest Neighbors and the Neural Network, both achieved an accuracy of 98%. The NN achieved a MCC of 0.96, while KNN achieved a MCC of 0.94. These figures outperform most existing literature and significantly outperform current methods of diagnosis. Conclusion and Significance  These robust results suggest that a machine learning approach can indeed be implemented to significantly improve diagnosis methods of Parkinson’s disease. Given the necessity of early diagnosis for effective treatment, my machine learning models provide a very promising alternative to the current, rather ineffective method of diagnosis. Current methods of early diagnosis are only 53% accurate, while my machine learning model produces 98% accuracy. This 45% increase is critical because an accurate, early diagnosis is needed to effectively treat the disease. Typically, by the time the disease is diagnosed, 60% of nigrostriatal neurons have degenerated, and 80% of striatal dopamine have been depleted. With an earlier diagnosis, much of this degradation could have been slowed or treated. My results are very significant because Parkinson’s affects over 10 million people worldwide who could benefit greatly from an early, accurate diagnosis. Not only is my machine learning approach more accurate in terms of diagnostic accuracy, it is also more scalable, less expensive, and therefore more accessible to people who might not have access to established medical facilities and professionals. The diagnosis is also much simpler, requiring only a 10-15 second voice recording and producing an immediate diagnosis. Future Research  Given more time and resources, I would investigate the following: Create a mobile application which would allow the user to record his/her voice, extract the necessary vocal features, and feed it into my machine learning model to diagnose Parkinson’s. Use larger datasets in conjunction with the University of Oxford dataset. Tune and improve my models even further to achieve even better results. Investigate different structures and types of neural networks. Construct a novel algorithm specifically suited for the prediction of Parkinson’s. Generalize my findings and algorithms for all types of dementia disorders, such as Alzheimer’s. References  Bind, Shubham.

jettbrains/-L-,"W3C Strategic Highlights  September 2019  This report was prepared for the September 2019 W3C Advisory Committee Meeting (W3C Member link). See the accompanying W3C Fact Sheet — September 2019. For the previous edition, see the April 2019 W3C Strategic Highlights. For future editions of this report, please consult the latest version.  A Chinese translation is available.  ☰ Contents  Introduction Future Web Standards Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments Digital Publishing Media and Entertainment Web & Telecommunications Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) Web & Networks Automotive Web of Things Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML CSS Fonts SVG Audio Performance Web Performance WebAssembly Testing Browser Testing and Tools WebPlatform Tests Web of Data Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity Internationalization (i18n) Web Accessibility Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations W3C Training Translations W3C Liaisons Introduction  This report highlights recent work of enhancement of the existing landscape of the Web platform and innovation for the growth and strength of the Web.  33 working groups and a dozen interest groups enable W3C to pursue its mission through the creation of Web standards, guidelines, and supporting materials. We track the tremendous work done across the Consortium through homogeneous work-spaces in Github which enables better monitoring and management.  We are in the middle of a period where we are chartering numerous working groups which demonstrate the rapid degree of change for the Web platform:  After 4 years, we are nearly ready to publish a Payment Request API Proposed Recommendation and we need to soon charter follow-on work. In the last year we chartered the Web Payment Security Interest Group. In the last year we chartered the Web Media Working Group with 7 specifications for next generation Media support on the Web. We have Accessibility Guidelines under W3C Member review which includes Silver, a new approach. We have just launched the Decentralized Identifier Working Group which has tremendous potential because Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is globally unique, resolveable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. We have Privacy IG (PING) under W3C Member review which strengthens our focus on the tradeoff between privacy and function. We have a new CSS charter under W3C Member review which maps the group's work for the next three years. In this period, W3C and the WHATWG have succesfully completed the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding rooted in the mutual belief that that having two distinct specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the Web community. The MOU, signed last May, describes how the two organizations are to collaborate on the development of a single authoritative version of the HTML and DOM specifications. W3C subsequently rechartered the HTML Working Group to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and for the production of W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  As the Web evolves continuously, some groups are looking for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called ""evergreen recommendations"" or ""living standards"" aim to track continuous development (and maintenance) of features, on a feature-by-feature basis, while getting review and patent commitments.  We see the maturation and further development of an incredible number of new technologies coming to the Web. Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the vitality of the W3C and the Web community, as the rest of the report illustrates.  Future Web Standards W3C has a variety of mechanisms for listening to what the community thinks could become good future Web standards. These include discussions with the Membership, discussions with other standards bodies, the activities of thousands of participants in over 300 community groups, and W3C Workshops. There are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team has been identifying promising topics and invites public participation.   Future, recent and under consideration Workshops include:  Inclusive XR (5-6 November 2019, Seattle, WA, USA) to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive, including to people with disabilities; W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (12-13 September 2019, Palo Alto, CA, USA) W3C Workshop on Web Games (27-28 June 2019, Redmond, WA, USA), view report Second W3C Workshop on the Web of Things (3-5 June 2019, Munich, Germany) W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data; Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL (4-6 March 2019, Berlin, Germany), view report Web & Machine Learning. The Strategy Funnel documents the staff's exploration of potential new work at various phases: Exploration and Investigation, Incubation and Evaluation, and eventually to the chartering of a new standards group. The Funnel view is a GitHub Project where new area are issues represented by “cards” which move through the columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start in Exploration and move towards Chartering, or move out of the funnel.  Public input is welcome at any stage but particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and indicate interest in participating in its standardization, and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall standardization process.  Since the previous highlights document, W3C has chartered a number of groups, and started discussion on many more:  Newly Chartered or Rechartered  Web Application Security WG (03-Apr) Web Payment Security IG (17-Apr) Patent and Standards IG (24-Apr) Web Applications WG (14-May) Web & Networks IG (16-May) Media WG (23-May) Media and Entertainment IG (06-Jun) HTML WG (06-Jun) Decentralized Identifier WG (05-Sep) Extended  Privacy IG (PING) (30-Sep) Verifiable Claims WG (30-Sep) Service Workers WG (31-Dec) Dataset Exchange WG (31-Dec) Web of Things Working Group (31-Dec) Web Audio Working Group (31-Dec) Proposed charters / Advance Notice  Accessibility Guidelines WG Privacy IG (PING) RDF Literal Direction WG Timed Text WG CSS WG Web Authentication WG Closed  Internationalization Tag Set IG Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments   All Web Payments specifications  W3C's payments standards enable a streamlined checkout experience, enabling a consistent user experience across the Web with lower front end development costs for merchants. Users can store and reuse information and more quickly and accurately complete online transactions.  The Web Payments Working Group has republished Payment Request API as a Candidate Recommendation, aiming to publish a Proposed Recommendation in the Fall 2019, and is discussing use cases and features for Payment Request after publication of the 1.0 Recommendation. Browser vendors have been finalizing implementation of features added in the past year (view the implementation report).  As work continues on the Payment Handler API and its implementation (currently in Chrome and Edge Canary), one focus in 2019 is to increase adoption in other browsers. Recently, Mastercard demonstrated the use of Payment Request API to carry out EMVCo's Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) protocol whose payment method definition is being developed with active participation by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Payment method availability is a key factor in merchant considerations about adopting Payment Request API. The ability to get uniform adoption of a new payment method such as Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) also depends on the availability of the Payment Handler API in browsers, or of proprietary alternatives.  Web Monetization, which the Web Payments Working Group will discuss again at its face-to-face meeting in September, can be used to enable micropayments as an alternative revenue stream to advertising.  Since the beginning of 2019, Amazon, Brave Software, JCB, Certus Cybersecurity Solutions and Netflix have joined the Web Payments Working Group.  In April, W3C launched the Web Payment Security Group to enable W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to collaborate on a vision for Web payment security and interoperability. Participants will define areas of collaboration and identify gaps between existing technical specifications in order to increase compatibility among different technologies, such as:  How do SRC, FIDO, and Payment Request relate? The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in Europe are scheduled to take effect in September 2019. What is the role of EMVCo, W3C, and FIDO technologies, and what is the current state of readiness for the deadline? How can we improve privacy on the Web at the same time as we meet industry requirements regarding user identity? Digital Publishing   All Digital Publishing specifications, Publication milestones  The Web is the universal publishing platform. Publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web, and the Web increasingly impacts Publishing.  Topic of particular interest to Publishing@W3C include typography and layout, accessibility, usability, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, print on demand, and reliable cross referencing. And the diverse publishing community represented in the groups consist of the traditional ""trade"" publishers, ebook reading system manufacturers, but also publishers of audio book, scholarly journals or educational materials, library scientists or browser developers.  The Publishing Working Group currently concentrates on Audiobooks which lack a comprehensive standard, thus incurring extra costs and time to publish in this booming market. Active development is ongoing on the future standard:  Publication Manifest Audiobook profile for Web Publications Lightweight Packaging Format The BD Comics Manga Community Group, the Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group, the Publishing Community Group and a future group on archival, are companions to the working group where specific work is developed and incubated.  The Publishing Community Group is a recently launched incubation channel for Publishing@W3C. The goal of the group is to propose, document, and prototype features broadly related to:  publications on the Web reading modes and systems and the user experience of publications The EPUB 3 Community Group has successfully completed the revision of EPUB 3.2.  The Publishing Business Group fosters ongoing participation by members of the publishing industry and the overall ecosystem in the development of Web infrastructure to better support the needs of the industry. The Business Group serves as an additional conduit to the Publishing Working Group and several Community Groups for feedback between the publishing ecosystem and W3C. The Publishing BG has played a vital role in fostering and advancing the adoption and continued development of EPUB 3. In particular the BG provided critical support to the update of EPUBCheck to validate EPUB content to the new EPUB 3.2 specification. This resulted in the development, in conjunction with the EPUB3 Community Group, of a new generation of EPUBCheck, i.e., EPUBCheck 4.2 production-ready release.  Media and Entertainment   All Media specifications  The Media and Entertainment vertical tracks media-related topics and features that create immersive experiences for end users. HTML5 brought standard audio and video elements to the Web. Standardization activities since then have aimed at turning the Web into a professional platform fully suitable for the delivery of media content and associated materials, enabling missing features to stream video content on the Web such as adaptive streaming and content protection. Together with Microsoft, Comcast, Netflix and Google, W3C received an Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in April 2019 for standardization of a full TV experience on the Web. Current goals are to:  Reinforce core media technologies: Creation of the Media Working Group, to develop media-related specifications incubated in the WICG (e.g. Media Capabilities, Picture-in-picture, Media Session) and maintain maintain/evolve Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). Improve support for Media Timed Events: data cues incubation. Enhance color support (HDR, wide gamut), in scope of the CSS WG and in the Color on the Web CG. Reduce fragmentation: Continue annual releases of a common and testable baseline media devices, in scope of the Web Media APIs CG and in collaboration with the CTA WAVE Project. Maintain the Road-map of Media Technologies for the Web which highlights Web technologies that can be used to build media applications and services, as well as known gaps to enable additional use cases. Create the future: Discuss perspectives for Media and Entertainment for the Web. Bring the power of GPUs to the Web (graphics, machine learning, heavy processing), under incubation in the GPU for the Web CG. Transition to a Working Group is under discussion. Determine next steps after the successful W3C Workshop on Web Games of June 2019. View the report. Timed Text  The Timed Text Working Group develops and maintains formats used for the representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio and video, and notably works on TTML, profiles of TTML, and WebVTT. Recent progress includes:  A robust WebVTT implementation report poises the specification for publication as a proposed recommendation. Discussions around re-chartering, notably to add a TTML Profile for Audio Description deliverable to the scope of the group, and clarify that rendering of captions within XR content is also in scope. Immersive Web  Hardware that enables Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications are now broadly available to consumers, offering an immersive computing platform with both new opportunities and challenges. The ability to interact directly with immersive hardware is critical to ensuring that the web is well equipped to operate as a first-class citizen in this environment.  The Immersive Web Working Group has been stabilizing the WebXR Device API while the companion Immersive Web Community Group incubates the next series of features identified as key for the future of the Immersive Web.  W3C plans a workshop focused on the needs and benefits at the intersection of VR & Accessibility (Inclusive XR), on 5-6 November 2019 in Seattle, WA, USA, to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive.  Web & Telecommunications  The Web is the Open Platform for Mobile. Telecommunication service providers and network equipment providers have long been critical actors in the deployment of Web technologies. As the Web platform matures, it brings richer and richer capabilities to extend existing services to new users and devices, and propose new and innovative services.  Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)   All Real-Time Communications specifications  WebRTC has reshaped the whole communication landscape by making any connected device a potential communication end-point, bringing audio and video communications anywhere, on any network, vastly expanding the ability of operators to reach their customers. WebRTC serves as the corner-stone of many online communication and collaboration services.  The WebRTC Working Group aims to bringing WebRTC 1.0 (and companion specification Media Capture and Streams) to Recommendation by the end of 2019. Intense efforts are focused on testing (supported by a dedicated hackathon at IETF 104) and interoperability. The group is considering pushing features that have not gotten enough traction to separate modules or to a later minor revision of the spec.  Beyond WebRTC 1.0, the WebRTC Working Group will focus its efforts on WebRTC NV which the group has started documenting by identifying use cases.  Web & Networks  Recently launched, in the wake of the May 2018 Web5G workshop, the Web & Networks Interest Group is chaired by representatives from AT&T, China Mobile and Intel, with a goal to explore solutions for web applications to achieve better performance and resource allocation, both on the device and network. The group's first efforts are around use cases, privacy & security requirements and liaisons.  Automotive   All Automotive specifications  To create a rich application ecosystem for vehicles and other devices allowed to connect to the vehicle, the W3C Automotive Working Group is delivering a service specification to expose all common vehicle signals (engine temperature, fuel/charge level, range, tire pressure, speed, etc.)  The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS), which is a Candidate Recommendation, is seeing more implementations across the industry. It provides the access method to a common data model for all the vehicle signals –presently encapsulating a thousand or so different data elements– and will be growing to accommodate the advances in automotive such as autonomous and driver assist technologies and electrification.  The group is already working on a successor to VISS, leveraging the underlying data model and the VIWI submission from Volkswagen, for a more robust means of accessing vehicle signals information and the same paradigm for other automotive needs including location-based services, media, notifications and caching content.  The Automotive and Web Platform Business Group acts as an incubator for prospective standards work. One of its task forces is using W3C VISS in performing data sampling and off-boarding the information to the cloud. Access to the wealth of information that W3C's auto signals standard exposes is of interest to regulators, urban planners, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, fleet managers and owners, service providers and others. In addition to components needed for data sampling and edge computing, capturing user and owner consent, information collection methods and handling of data are in scope.  The upcoming W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (September 2019) is expected to focus on the need of additional ontologies around transportation space.  Web of Things   All Web of Things specifications  W3C's Web of Things work is designed to bridge disparate technology stacks to allow devices to work together and achieve scale, thus enabling the potential of the Internet of Things by eliminating fragmentation and fostering interoperability.  Thing descriptions expressed in JSON-LD cover the behavior, interaction affordances, data schema, security configuration, and protocol bindings. The Web of Things complements existing IoT ecosystems to reduce the cost and risk for suppliers and consumers of applications that create value by combining multiple devices and information services. There are many sectors that will benefit, e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart industry, smart agriculture, smart healthcare and many more.  The Web of Things Working Group is finishing the initial Web of Things standards, with support from the Web of Things Interest Group:  Web of Things Architecture Thing Descriptions Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML   The HTML Working Group was chartered early June to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and to produce W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  A few days before, W3C and the WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.  Issues and proposed solutions for HTML and DOM done via the newly rechartered HTML Working Group in the WHATWG repositories  The HTML Working Group is targetting November 2019 to bring HTML and DOM to Candidate Recommendations.  CSS  All CSS specifications  CSS is a critical part of the Open Web Platform. The CSS Working Group gathers requirements from two large groups of CSS users: the publishing industry and application developers. Within W3C, those groups are exemplified by the Publishing groups and the Web Platform Working Group. The former requires things like better pagination support and advanced font handling, the latter needs intelligent (and fast!) scrolling and animations.  What we know as CSS is actually a collection of almost a hundred specifications, referred to as ‘modules’. The current state of CSS is defined by a snapshot, updated once a year. The group also publishes an index defining every term defined by CSS specifications.  Fonts   All Fonts specifications  The Web Fonts Working Group develops specifications that allow the interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web, with a focus on Progressive Font Enrichment as well as maintenance of WOFF Recommendations.  Recent and ongoing work includes:  Early API experiments by Adobe and Monotype have demonstrated the feasibility of a font enrichment API, where a server delivers a font with minimal glyph repertoire and the client can query the full repertoire and request additional subsets on-the-fly. In other experiments, the Brotli compression used in WOFF 2 was extended to support shared dictionaries and patch update. Metrics to quantify improvement are a current hot discussion topic. The group will meet at ATypi 2019 in Japan, to gather requirements from the international typography community. The group will first produce a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each prototype solution by Q2 2020. SVG   All SVG specifications  SVG is an important and widely-used part of the Open Web Platform. The SVG Working Group focuses on aligning the SVG 2.0 specification with browser implementations, having split the specification into a currently-implemented 2.0 and a forward-looking 2.1. Current activity is on stabilization, increased integration with the Open Web Platform, and test coverage analysis.  The Working Group was rechartered in March 2019. A new work item concerns native (non-Web-browser) uses of SVG as a non-interactive, vector graphics format.  Audio  The Web Audio Working Group was extended to finish its work on the Web Audio API, expecting to publish it as a Recommendation by year end. The specification enables synthesizing audio in the browser. Audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form a modular audio routing graph. Multiple sources — with different types of channel layout — are supported. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.  The first version of Web Audio API is now feature complete and is implemented in all modern browsers. Work has started on the next version, and new features are being incubated in the Audio Community Group.  Performance   Web Performance  All Web Performance specifications  There are currently 18 specifications in development in the Web Performance Working Group aiming to provide methods to observe and improve aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs. The W3C team is looking at related work incubated in the W3C GPU for the Web (WebGPU) Community Group which is poised to transition to a W3C Working Group. A preliminary draft charter is available.  WebAssembly  All WebAssembly specifications  WebAssembly improves Web performance and power by being a virtual machine and execution environment enabling loaded pages to run native (compiled) code. It is deployed in Firefox, Edge, Safari and Chrome. The specification will soon reach Candidate Recommendation.  WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for existing code bases. While it has a small number of native types, much of the performance increase relative to Javascript derives from its use of consistent typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for compiled languages and the byte code is optimized for compactness and streaming (the web page starts executing while the rest of the code downloads). Network and API access all occurs through accompanying Javascript libraries -- the security model is identical to that of Javascript.  Requirements gathering and language development occur in the Community Group while the Working Group manages test development, community review and progression of specifications on the Recommendation Track.  Testing  Browser testing plays a critical role in the growth of the Web by:  Improving the reliability of Web technology definitions; Improving the quality of implementations of these technologies by helping vendors to detect bugs in their products; Improving the data available to Web developers on known bugs and deficiencies of Web technologies by publishing results of these tests. Browser Testing and Tools  The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group is developing WebDriver version 2, having published last year the W3C Recommendation of WebDriver. WebDriver acts as a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents, provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of Web, and emulates the actions of a real person using the browser.  WebPlatform Tests   The WebPlatform Tests project now provides a mechanism which allows to fully automate tests that previously needed to be run manually: TestDriver.  TestDriver enables sending trusted key and mouse events, sending complex series of trusted pointer and key interactions for things like in-content drag-and-drop or pinch zoom, and even file upload.  Since 2014 W3C began work on this coordinated open-source effort to build a cross-browser test suite for the Web Platform, which WHATWG, and all major browsers adopted.  Web of Data   All Data specifications  There have been several great success stories around the standardization of data on the web over the past year.  Verifiable Claims seems to have significant uptake. It is also significant that the Distributed Identifier WG charter has received numerous favorable reviews, and was just recently launched. JSON-LD has been a major success with the large deployment on Web sites via schema.org.  JSON-LD 1.1 completed technical work, about to transition to CR More than 25% of websites today include schema.org data in JSON-LD The Web of Things description is in CR since May, making use of JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials data model is in CR since July, also making use of JSON-LD Continued strong interest in decentralized identifiers Engagement from the TAG with reframing core documents, such as Ethical Web Principles, to include data on the web within their scope Data is increasingly important for all organizations, especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. W3C has a mature and extensive suite of standards relating to data that were developed over two decades of experience, with plans for further work on making it easier for developers to work with graph data and knowledge graphs.  Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information and to include links to other data. There are ever-increasing sources of open Linked Data on the Web, as well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and consumers of those services.  The digital transformation of industry is seeking to exploit advanced digital technologies. This will facilitate businesses to integrate horizontally along the supply and value chains, and vertically from the factory floor to the office floor. W3C is seeking to make it easier to support enterprise-wide data management and governance, reflecting the strategic importance of data to modern businesses.  Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular databases (SQL/RDBMS), Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets. We're now in midst of a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled directed links between them. Graph data is:  Faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations More favorable to integrating data from heterogeneous sources Better suited to situations where the data model is evolving In the wake of the recent W3C Workshop on Graph Data we are in the process of launching a Graph Standardization Business Group to provide a business perspective with use cases and requirements, to coordinate technical standards work and liaisons with external organizations.  Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity  All Security specifications, all Privacy specifications  Authentication on the Web   As the WebAuthn Level 1 W3C Recommendation published last March is seeing wide implementation and adoption of strong cryptographic authentication, work is proceeding on Level 2.  The open standard Web API gives native authentication technology built into native platforms, browsers, operating systems (including mobile) and hardware, offering protection against hacking, credential theft, phishing attacks, thus aiming to end the era of passwords as a security construct. You may read more in our March press release.  Privacy  An increasing number of W3C specifications are benefitting from Privacy and Security review; there are security and privacy aspects to every specification. Early review is essential. Working with the TAG, the Privacy Interest Group has updated the Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy.  Other recent work of the group includes public blogging further to the exploration of anti-patterns in standards and permission prompts.  Security  The Web Application Security Working Group adopted Feature Policy, aiming to allow developers to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of some of these browser features and APIs within their application; and Fetch Metadata, aiming to provide servers with enough information to make a priori decisions about whether or not to service a request based on the way it was made, and the context in which it will be used.  The Web Payment Security Interest Group, launched last April, convenes members from W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to discuss cooperative work to enhance the security and interoperability of Web payments (read more about payments).  Internationalization (i18n)   All Internationalization specifications, educational articles related to Internationalization, spec developers checklist  Only a quarter or so current Web users use English online and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the ""World Wide"" portion of its name, and for the Web to truly work for stakeholders all around the world engaging with content in various languages, it must support the needs of worldwide users as they engage with content in the various languages. The growth of epublishing also brings requirements for new features and improved typography on the Web. It is important to ensure the needs of local communities are captured.  The W3C Internationalization Initiative was set up to increase in-house resources dedicated to accelerating progress in making the World Wide Web ""worldwide"" by gathering user requirements, supporting developers, and education & outreach.  For an overview of current projects see the i18n radar. W3C's Internationalization efforts progressed on a number of fronts recently:  Requirements: New African and European language groups will work on the gap analysis, errata and layout requirements. Gap analysis: Japanese, Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, and Ethiopic updated in the gap-analysis documents. Layout requirements document: notable progress tracked in the Southeast Asian Task Force while work continues on Chinese layout requirements. Developer support: Spec reviews: the i18n WG continues active review of specifications of the WHATWG and other W3C Working Groups. Short review checklist: easy way to begin a self-review to help spec developers understand what aspects of their spec are likely to need attention for internationalization, and points them to more detailed checklists for the relevant topics. It also helps those reviewing specs for i18n issues. Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata lays out issues and discusses potential solutions for passing information about language and direction with strings in JSON or other data formats. The document was rewritten for clarity, and expanded. The group is collaborating with the JSON-LD and Web Publishing groups to develop a plan for updating RDF, JSON-LD and related specifications to handle metadata for base direction of text (bidi). User-friendly test format: a new format was developed for Internationalization Test Suite tests, which displays helpful information about how the test works. This particularly useful because those tests are pointed to by educational materials and gap-analysis documents. Web Platform Tests: a large number of tests in the i18n test suite have been ported to the WPT repository, including: css-counter-styles, css-ruby, css-syntax, css-test, css-text-decor, css-writing-modes, and css-pseudo. Education & outreach: (for all educational materials, see the HTML & CSS Authoring Techniques) Web Accessibility   All Accessibility specifications, WAI resources  The Web Accessibility Initiative supports W3C's Web for All mission. Recent achievements include:  Education and training: Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA updated to bring our analysis and recommendations up to date with CAPTCHA practice today, concluding two years of extensive work and invaluable input from the public (read more on the W3C Blog Learn why your web content and applications should be accessible. The Education and Outreach Working Group has completed revision and updating of the Business Case for Digital Accessibility. Accessibility guidelines: The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has continued to update WCAG Techniques and Understanding WCAG 2.1; and published a Candidate Recommendation of Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules Format 1.0 to improve inter-rater reliability when evaluating conformance of web content to WCAG An updated charter is being developed to host work on ""Silver"", the next generation accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.2) There are accessibility aspects to most specifications. Check your work with the FAST checklist.  Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations   To foster the excellent feedback loop between Web Standards development and Web developers, and to grow participation from that diverse community, recent W3C Developer Relations activities include:  @w3cdevs tracks the enormous amount of work happening across W3C W3C Track during the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco Tech videos: W3C published the 2019 Web Games Workshop videos The 16 September 2019 Developer Meetup in Fukuoka, Japan, is open to all and will combine a set of technical demos prepared by W3C groups, and a series of talks on a selected set of W3C technologies and projects W3C is involved with Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Bocoup in the organization of ViewSource 2019 in Amsterdam (read more on the W3C Blog) W3C Training   In partnership with EdX, W3C's MOOC training program, W3Cx offers a complete ""Front-End Web Developer"" (FEWD) professional certificate program that consists of a suite of five courses on the foundational languages that power the Web: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We count nearly 900K students from all over the world.  Translations  Many Web users rely on translations of documents developed at W3C whose official language is English. W3C is extremely grateful to the continuous efforts of its community in ensuring our various deliverables in general, and in our specifications in particular, are made available in other languages, for free, ensuring their exposure to a much more diverse set of readers.  Last Spring we developed a more robust system, a new listing of translations of W3C specifications and updated the instructions on how to contribute to our translation efforts.  W3C Liaisons   Liaisons and coordination with numerous organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) is crucial for W3C to:  make sure standards are interoperable coordinate our respective agenda in Internet governance: W3C participates in ICANN, GIPO, IGF, the I* organizations (ICANN, IETF, ISOC, IAB). ensure at the government liaison level that our standards work is officially recognized when important to our membership so that products based on them (often done by our members) are part of procurement orders. W3C has ARO/PAS status with ISO. W3C participates in the EU MSP and Rolling Plan on Standardization ensure the global set of Web and Internet standards form a compatible stack of technologies, at the technical and policy level (patent regime, fragmentation, use in policy making) promote Standards adoption equally by the industry, the public sector, and the public at large Coralie Mercier, Editor, W3C Marketing & Communications $Id: Overview.html,v 1.60 2019/10/15 12:05:52 coralie Exp $ Copyright © 2019 W3C ® (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang) Usage policies apply.",68,,32,https://github.com/jettbrains/-L-,2019-10-28 21:50:26+00:00,2024-10-05 18:30:44+00:00

Sign up for Medium and get an extra one  Kush Kush Follow Apr 15, 2021  · 7 min read ·  Listen   Save      How you can Control your Android Device with Python Photo by Caspar Camille Rubin on Unsplash Photo by Caspar Camille Rubin on Unsplash Introduction A while back I was thinking of ways in which I could annoy my friends by spamming them with messages for a few minutes, and while doing some research I came across the Android Debug Bridge. In this quick guide I will show you how you can interface with it using Python and how to create 2 quick scripts.  The ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is a command line tool (CLI) which can be used to control and communicate with an Android device. You can do many things such as install apps, debug apps, find hidden features and use a shell to interface with the device directly. To enable the ADB, your device must firstly have Developer Options unlocked and USB debugging enabled. To unlock developer options, you can go to your devices settings and scroll down to the about section and find the build number of the current software which is on the device. Click the build number 7 times and Developer Options will be enabled. Then you can go to the Developer Options panel in the settings and enable USB debugging from there. Now the only other thing you need is a USB cable to connect your device to your computer.  Here is what todays journey will look like:  Installing the requirements Getting started The basics of writing scripts Creating a selfie timer Creating a definition searcher Installing the requirements The first of the 2 things we need to install, is the ADB tool on our computer. This comes automatically bundled with Android Studio, so if you already have that then do not worry. Otherwise, you can head over to the official docs and at the top of the page there should be instructions on how to install it.  Once you have installed the ADB tool, you need to get the python library which we will use to interface with the ADB and our device. You can install the pure-python-adb library using pip install pure-python-adb.  Optional: To make things easier for us while developing our scripts, we can install an open-source program called scrcpy which allows us to display and control our android device with our computer using a mouse and keyboard. To install it, you can head over to the Github repo and download the correct version for your operating system (Windows, macOS or Linux). If you are on Windows, then extract the zip file into a directory and add this directory to your path. This is so we can access the program from anywhere on our system just by typing in scrcpy into our terminal window.  Getting started Now that all the dependencies are installed, we can start up our ADB and connect our device. Firstly, connect your device to your PC with the USB cable, if USB debugging is enabled then a message should pop up asking if it is okay for your PC to control the device, simply answer yes. Then on your PC, open up a terminal window and start the ADB server by typing in adb start-server. This should print out the following messages:  * daemon not running; starting now at tcp:5037 * daemon started successfully If you also installed scrcpy, then you can start that by just typing scrcpy into the terminal. However, this will only work if you added it to your path, otherwise you can open the executable by changing your terminal directory to the directory of where you installed scrcpy and typing scrcpy.exe. Hopefully if everything works out, you should be able to see your device on your PC and be able to control it using your mouse and keyboard.  Now we can create a new python file and check if we can find our connected device using the library:   Here we import the AdbClient class and create a client object using it. Then we can get a list of devices connected. Lastly, we get the first device out of our list (it is generally the only one there if there is only one device connected).  The basics of writing scripts The main way we are going to interface with our device is using the shell, through this we can send commands to simulate a touch at a specific location or to swipe from A to B. To simulate screen touches (taps) we first need to work out how the screen coordinates work. To help with these we can activate the pointer location setting in the developer options. Once activated, wherever you touch on the screen, you can see that the coordinates for that point appear at the top. The coordinate system works like this:  A diagram to show how the coordinate system works A diagram to show how the coordinate system works The top left corner of the display has the x and y coordinates (0, 0) respectively, and the bottom right corners’ coordinates are the largest possible values of x and y.  Now that we know how the coordinate system works, we need to check out the different commands we can run. I have made a list of commands and how to use them below for quick reference:  Input tap x y Input text “hello world!” Input keyevent eventID Here is a list of some common eventID’s: 3: home button 4: back button 5: call 6: end call 24: volume up 25: volume down 26: turn device on or off 27: open camera 64: open browser 66: enter 67: backspace 207: contacts 220: brightness down 221: brightness up 277: cut 278: copy 279: paste If you wanted to find more, here is a long list of them here.  Creating a selfie timer Now we know what we can do, let’s start doing it. In this first example I will show you how to create a quick selfie timer. To get started we need to import our libraries and create a connect function to connect to our device:   You can see that the connect function is identical to the previous example of how to connect to your device, except here we return the device and client objects for later use.   In our main code, we can call the connect function to retrieve the device and client objects. From there we can open up the camera app, wait 5 seconds and take a photo. It’s really that simple! As I said before, this is simply replicating what you would usually do, so thinking about how to do things is best if you do them yourself manually first and write down the steps.  Creating a definition searcher We can do something a bit more complex now, and that is to ask the browser to find the definition of a particular word and take a screenshot to save it on our computer.  The basic flow of this program will be as such:  1. Open the browser 2. Click the search bar 3. Enter the search query 4. Wait a few seconds 5. Take a screenshot and save it But, before we get started, you need to find the coordinates of your search bar in your default browser, you can use the method I suggested earlier to find them easily. For me they were (440, 200).  To start, we will have to import the same libraries as before, and we will also have our same connect method.   In our main function we can call the connect function, as well as assign a variable to the x and y coordinates of our search bar. Notice how this is a string and not a list or tuple, this is so we can easily incorporate the coordinates into our shell command. We can also take an input from the user to see what word they want to get the definition for:   We will add that query to a full sentence which will then be searched, this is so that we can always get the definition. After that we can open the browser and input our search query into the search bar as such:   Here we use the eventID 66 to simulate the press of the enter key to execute our search. If you wanted to, you could change the wait timings per your needs.  Lastly, we will take a screenshot using the screencap method on our device object, and we can save that as a .png file:  Here we must open the file in the write bytes mode because the screencap method returns bytes representing the image.  If all went according to plan, you should have a quick script which searches for a specific word. Here it is working on my phone:  A GIF to show how the definition searcher example works on my phone A GIF to show how the definition searcher example works on my phone Final thoughts Hopefully you have learned something new today, personally I never even knew this was a thing before I did some research into it. The cool thing is, that you can do anything you normal would be able to do, and more since it just simulates your own touches and actions!  I hope you enjoyed the article and thank you for reading! 💖  468   9  468   9    More from ITNEXT Follow ITNEXT is a platform for IT developers & software engineers to share knowledge, connect, collaborate, learn and experience next-gen technologies.

SOYJUN/TCP-socket-client-server,"The aim of this assignment is to have you do TCP socket client / server programming using I/O multiplexing, child processes and threads. It also aims at getting you to familiarize yourselves with the inetd superserver daemon, the ‘exec’ family of functions, various socket error scenarios, some socket options, and some basic domain name / IP address conversion functions. Apart from the material in Chapters 1 to 6 covered in class, you will also need to refer to the following :  the exec family of functions (Section 4.7 of Chapter 4)  using pipes for interprocess communication (IPC) in Unix  error scenarios induced by process terminations & host crashes (Sections 5.11 to 5.16, Chapter 5)  setsockopt function & SO_REUSEADDR socket option (Section 7.2 & pp.210-213, Chapter 7)  gethostbyname & gethostbyaddr functions (Sections 11.3 & 11.4, Chapter 11)  the basic structure of inetd (Section 13.5, Chapter 13)  programming with threads (Sections 26.1 to 26.5, Chapter 26) Overview  I shall present an overview of this assignment and discuss some of the specification details given below in class on Wednesday, September 17 & Monday, September 22.  Client  The client is evoked with a command line argument giving either the server IP address in dotted decimal notation, or the server domain name. The client has to be able to handle either mode and figure out which of the two is being passed to it. If it is given the IP address, it calls the gethostbyaddr function to get the domain name, which it then prints out to the user in the form of an appropriate message (e.g., ‘The server host is compserv1.cs.stonybrook.edu’). The function gethostbyname, on the other hand, returns the IP address that corresponds to a given domain name. The client then enters an infinite loop in which it queries the user which service is being requested. There are two options : echo and time (note that time is a slightly modified version of the daytime service – see below). The client then forks off a child. After the child is forked off, the parent process enters a second loop in which it continually reads and prints out status messages received from the child via a half-duplex pipe (see below). The parent exits the second loop when the child closes the pipe (how does the parent detect this?), and/or the SIGCHLD signal is generated when the child terminates. The parent then repeats the outer loop, querying the user again for the (next) service s/he desires. This cycle continues till the user responds to a query with quit rather than echo or time.  The child process is the one which handles the actual service for the user. It execs (see Section 4.7, Chapter 4) an xterm to generate a separate window through which all interactions with server and user take place. For example, the following exec function call evokes an xterm, and gets the xterm to execute echocli, located in the current directory, passing the string 127.0.0.1 (assumed to be the IP address of the server) as the command line argument argv[1] to echocli (click on the url for further details) :  execlp(""xterm"", ""xterm"", ""-e"", ""./echocli"", ""127.0.0.1"", (char *) 0)  xterm executes one of two client programs (echocli or timecli, say) depending on the service requested. A client program establishes a TCP connection to the server at the ‘well-known port’ for the service (in reality, this port will, of course, be some ephemeral port of your choosing, the value of which is known to both server and client code). All interaction with the user, on the one hand, and with the server, on the other, takes place through the child’s xterm window, not the parent’s window. On the other hand, the child will use a half-duplex pipe to relay status information to the parent which the parent prints out in its window (see below).To terminate the echo client, the user can type in ^D (CTRL D, the EOF character). To terminate the time client, the only option is for the user to type in ^C (CTRL C). (This can also be used as an alternative means of terminating the echo client.) Note that using ^C in the context of the time service will give the server process the impression that the client process has ‘crashed’. It is your responsibility to ensure that the server process handles this correctly and closes cleanly. I shall address this further when discussing the server process.  It is also part of your responsibility in this assignment to ensure that the client code is robust with respect to the server process crashing (see Sections 5.12 & 5.13, Chapter 5). Amongst other implications, this means that it would probably be a good idea for you to implement your echo client code along the lines of either : Figure 6.9, p.168 (or even Figure 6.13, p.174) which uses I/O multiplexing with the select function; or of Figure 26.2, p.680, which uses threads; rather than along the lines of Figure 5.5, p.125.  When the child terminates, either normally or abnormally, its xterm window disappears instantaneously. Consequently, any status information that the child might want to communicate to the user should not be printed out on the child’s xterm window, since the user will not have time to see the final such message before the window disappears. Instead, as the parent forks off the child at the beginning, a half-duplex pipe should be established from child to parent. The child uses the pipe to send status reports to the parent, which the parent prints out in its window. I leave it up to you to decide what status information exactly should be relayed to the parent but, at a minimum, the parent should certainly be notified, in as precise terms as possible, of any abnormal termination conditions of the service provided by the child.  In general, you should try to make your code as robust as possible with respect to handling errors, including confused behaviour by the user (e.g., passing an invalid command line argument; responding to a query incorrectly; trying to interact with the service through the parent process window, not the child process xterm; etc.). Amongst other things, you have to worry about EINTR errors occurring during slow system calls (such as the parent reading from the pipe, or, possibly, printing to stdout, for example) due to a SIGCHLD signal. What about other kinds of errors? Which ones can occur? How should you handle them?  Server  The server has to be able to handle multiple clients using threads (specifically, detached threads), not child processes (see Sections 26.1 to 26.4, Chapter 26). Furthermore, it has to be able to handle multiple types of service; in our case, two : echo and time. echo is just the standard echo service we have seen in class. time is a slightly modified version of the daytime service (see Figure 1.9, p.14) : instead of sending the client the ‘daytime’ just once and closing, the service sits in an infinite loop, sending the ‘daytime’, sleeping for 5 seconds, and repeating, ad infinitum.  The server is loosely based on the way the inetd daemon works : see Figure 13.7, p.374. However, note that the differences between inetd and our server are probably more significant than the similarities: inetd forks off children, whereas our server uses threads; inetd child processes issue exec commands, which our server threads do not; etc. So you should treat Figure 13.7 (and Section 13.5, Chapter 13, generally) as a source of ideas, not as a set of specifications which you must slavishly adhere to and copy. Note, by the way, that there are some similarities between our client and inetd (primarily, forking off children which issue execs), which could be a useful source of ideas.  The server creates a listening socket for each type of service that it handles, bound to the ‘well-known port’ for that service. It then uses select to await clients (Chapter 6; or, if you prefer, poll; note that pselect is not supported in Solaris 2.10). The socket on which a client connects identifies the service the client is seeking. The server accepts the connection and creates a thread which provides the service. The thread detaches itself. Meanwhile, the main thread goes back to the select to await further clients.  A major concern when using threads is to make sure that operations are thread safe (see p.685 and on into Section 26.5). In this respect, Stevens’ readline function (in Stevens’ file unpv13e/lib/readline.c, see Figure 3.18, pp.91-92) poses a particular problem. On p.686, the authors give three options for dealing with this. The third option is too inefficient and should be discarded. You can implement the second option if you wish. Easiest of all would be the first option, since it involves using a thread-safe version of readline (see Figures 26.11 & 26.12) provided in file unpv13e/threads/readline.c. Whatever you do, remember that Stevens’ library, libunp.a, contains the non-thread-safe version of Figure 3.18, and that is the version that will be link-loaded to your code unless you undertake explicit steps to ensure this does not happen (libunp.a also contains the ‘wrapper’ function Readline, whose code is also in file unpv13e/lib/readline.c). Remaking your copy of libunp.a with the ‘correct’ version of readline is not a viable option because when you hand in your code, it will be compiled and link-loaded with respect to the version of libunp.a in the course account, ~cse533/Stevens/unpv13e_solaris2.10 (I do not intend to change that version since it risks creating confusion later on in the course). Also, you will probably want to use the original version of readline in the client code anyway. I am providing you with a sample Makefile which picks up the thread-safe version of readline from directory ~cse533/Stevens/unpv13e_solaris2.10/threads and uses it when making the executable for the server, but leaves the other executables it makes to link-load the non-thread-safe version from libunp.a.  Again, it is part of your responsibility to make sure that your server code is as robust as possible with respect to errors, and that the server threads terminate cleanly under all circumstances. Recall, first of all, that the client user will often use ^C (CTRL C) in the xterm to terminate the service. This will appear to the server thread as if the client process has crashed. You need to think about the error conditions that will be induced (see Sections 5.11 to 5.13, Chapter 5), and how the echo and time server code is to detect and handle these conditions. For example, the time server will almost certainly experience an EPIPE error (see Section 5.13). How should the associated SIGPIPE signal be handled? Be aware that when we return out of the Stevens’ writen function with -1 (indicating an error) and check errno, errno is sometimes equal to 0, not EPIPE (value 32). This can happen under Solaris 2.10, but I am not sure under precisely what conditions nor why. Nor am I sure if it also happens under other Unix versions, or if it also happens when using write rather than writen. The point is, you cannot depend on errno to find out what has happened to the write or writen functions. My suggestion, therefore, is that the time server should use the select function. On the one hand, select’s timeout mechanism can be used to make the server sleep for the 5 seconds. On the other hand, select should also monitor the connection socket read event because, when the client xterm is ^C’ed, a FIN will be sent to the server TCP, which will prime the socket for reading; a read on the socket will then return with value 0 (see Figure 14.3, p. 385 as an example).  But what about errors other than EPIPE? Which ones can occur? How should you handle them? Recall, as well, that if a thread terminates without explicitly closing the connection socket it has been using, the connection socket will remain existent until the server process itself dies (why?). Since the server process is supposed, in principle, to run for ever, you risk ending up with an ever increasing number of unused, ‘orphaned’ sockets unless you are careful.  Whenever a server thread detects the termination of its client, it should print out a message giving appropriate details: e.g., “Client termination: EPIPE error detected”, “Client termination: socket read returned with value 0”, “Client termination: socket read returned with value -1, errno = . . .”, and so on.  When debugging your server code, you will probably find that restarting the server very shortly after it was last running will give you trouble when it comes to bind to its ‘well-known ports’. This is because, when the server side initiates connection termination (which is what will happen if the server process crashes; or if you kill it first, before killing the client) TCP keeps the connections open in the TIME_WAIT state for 2MSLs (Sections 2.6 & 2.7, Chapter 2). This could very quickly become a major irritant. I suggest you explore the possibility of using the SO_REUSEADDR socket option (pp.210-213, Chapter 7; note that the SO_REUSEPORT socket option is not supported in Solaris 2.10), which should help keep the stress level down. You will need to use the setsockopt function (Section 7.2) to enable this option. Figure 8.24, p.263, shows an instance of server code that sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option.  Finally, you should be aware of the sort of problem, described in Section 16.6, pp.461-463, that might occur when (blocking) listening sockets are monitored using select. Such sockets should be made nonblocking, which requires use of the fcntl  function after socket creates the socket, but before listen turns the socket into a listening socket.",39,C,19,https://github.com/SOYJUN/TCP-socket-client-server,2015-04-10 18:12:23+00:00,2024-05-27 15:41:29+00:00

Tinkprocodes/fca-unofficial,"This repo is a fork from main repo and will usually have new features bundled faster than main repo (and maybe bundle some bugs, too).  # Unofficial Facebook Chat API <img alt=""version"" src=""https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/ProCoderMew/fca-unofficial?label=github&style=flat-square"">  Facebook now has an official API for chat bots [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform).  This API is the only way to automate chat functionalities on a user account. We do this by emulating the browser. This means doing the exact same GET/POST requests and tricking Facebook into thinking we're accessing the website normally. Because we're doing it this way, this API won't work with an auth token but requires the credentials of a Facebook account.  _Disclaimer_: We are not responsible if your account gets banned for spammy activities such as sending lots of messages to people you don't know, sending messages very quickly, sending spammy looking URLs, logging in and out very quickly... Be responsible Facebook citizens.  See [below](#projects-using-this-api) for projects using this API.  ## Install If you just want to use fca-unofficial, you should use this command: ```bash npm install procodermew/fca-unofficial ``` It will download `fca-unofficial` from NPM repositories  ## Testing your bots If you want to test your bots without creating another account on Facebook, you can use [Facebook Whitehat Accounts](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/accounts/).  ## Example Usage ```javascript const login = require(""fca-unofficial"");  // Create simple echo bot login({email: ""FB_EMAIL"", password: ""FB_PASSWORD""}, (err, api) => {     if(err) return console.error(err);      api.listen((err, message) => {         api.sendMessage(message.body, message.threadID);     }); }); ```  Result:  <img width=""517"" alt=""screen shot 2016-11-04 at 14 36 00"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4534692/20023545/f8c24130-a29d-11e6-9ef7-47568bdbc1f2.png"">   ## Documentation  You can see it [here](DOCS.md).  ## Main Functionality  ### Sending a message #### api.sendMessage(message, threadID[, callback][, messageID])  Various types of message can be sent: * *Regular:* set field `body` to the desired message as a string. * *Sticker:* set a field `sticker` to the desired sticker ID. * *File or image:* Set field `attachment` to a readable stream or an array of readable streams. * *URL:* set a field `url` to the desired URL. * *Emoji:* set field `emoji` to the desired emoji as a string and set field `emojiSize` with size of the emoji (`small`, `medium`, `large`)  Note that a message can only be a regular message (which can be empty) and optionally one of the following: a sticker, an attachment or a url.  __Tip__: to find your own ID, you can look inside the cookies. The `userID` is under the name `c_user`.  __Example (Basic Message)__ ```js const login = require(""fca-unofficial"");  login({email: ""FB_EMAIL"", password: ""FB_PASSWORD""}, (err, api) => {     if(err) return console.error(err);      var yourID = ""000000000000000"";     var msg = ""Hey!"";     api.sendMessage(msg, yourID); }); ```  __Example (File upload)__ ```js const login = require(""fca-unofficial"");  login({email: ""FB_EMAIL"", password: ""FB_PASSWORD""}, (err, api) => {     if(err) return console.error(err);      // Note this example uploads an image called image.jpg     var yourID = ""000000000000000"";     var msg = {         body: ""Hey!"",         attachment: fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/image.jpg')     }     api.sendMessage(msg, yourID); }); ```  ------------------------------------ ### Saving session.  To avoid logging in every time you should save AppState (cookies etc.) to a file, then you can use it without having password in your scripts.  __Example__  ```js const fs = require(""fs""); const login = require(""fca-unofficial"");  var credentials = {email: ""FB_EMAIL"", password: ""FB_PASSWORD""};  login(credentials, (err, api) => {     if(err) return console.error(err);      fs.writeFileSync('appstate.json', JSON.stringify(api.getAppState())); }); ```  Alternative: Use [c3c-fbstate](https://github.com/c3cbot/c3c-fbstate) to get fbstate.json (appstate.json)  ------------------------------------  ### Listening to a chat #### api.listen(callback)  Listen watches for messages sent in a chat. By default this won't receive events (joining/leaving a chat, title change etc…) but it can be activated with `api.setOptions({listenEvents: true})`. This will by default ignore messages sent by the current account, you can enable listening to your own messages with `api.setOptions({selfListen: true})`.  __Example__  ```js const fs = require(""fs""); const login = require(""fca-unofficial"");  // Simple echo bot. It will repeat everything that you say. // Will stop when you say '/stop' login({appState: JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('appstate.json', 'utf8'))}, (err, api) => {     if(err) return console.error(err);      api.setOptions({listenEvents: true});      var stopListening = api.listenMqtt((err, event) => {         if(err) return console.error(err);          api.markAsRead(event.threadID, (err) => {             if(err) console.error(err);         });          switch(event.type) {             case ""message"":                 if(event.body === '/stop') {                     api.sendMessage(""Goodbye…"", event.threadID);                     return stopListening();                 }                 api.sendMessage(""TEST BOT: "" + event.body, event.threadID);                 break;             case ""event"":                 console.log(event);                 break;         }     }); }); ```  ## FAQS  1. How do I run tests? > For tests, create a `test-config.json` file that resembles `example-config.json` and put it in the `test` directory. From the root >directory, run `npm test`.  2. Why doesn't `sendMessage` always work when I'm logged in as a page? > Pages can't start conversations with users directly; this is to prevent pages from spamming users.  3. What do I do when `login` doesn't work? > First check that you can login to Facebook using the website. If login approvals are enabled, you might be logging in incorrectly. For how to handle login approvals, read our docs on [`login`](DOCS.md#login).  4. How can I avoid logging in every time?  Can I log into a previous session? > We support caching everything relevant for you to bypass login. `api.getAppState()` returns an object that you can save and pass into login as `{appState: mySavedAppState}` instead of the credentials object.  If this fails, your session has expired.  5. Do you support sending messages as a page? > Yes, set the pageID option on login (this doesn't work if you set it using api.setOptions, it affects the login process). > ```js > login(credentials, {pageID: ""000000000000000""}, (err, api) => { … } > ```  6. I'm getting some crazy weird syntax error like `SyntaxError: Unexpected token [`!!! > Please try to update your version of node.js before submitting an issue of this nature.

nyaundid/EC2-AWS-AND-SHELL,"SEIS 665 Assignment 2: Linux & Git Overview This week we will focus on becoming familiar with launching a Linux server and working with some basic Linux and Git commands. We will use AWS to launch and host the Linux server. AWS might seem a little confusing at this point. Don’t worry, we will gain much more hands-on experience with AWS throughout the course. The goal is to get you comfortable working with the technology and not overwhelm you with all the details.  Requirements You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment. You should also read the Git Hands-on Guide and Linux Hands-on Guide before beginning this exercise.  A word about grading One of the key DevOps practices we learn about in this class is the use of automation to increase the speed and repeatability of processes. Automation is utilized during the assignment grading process to review and assess your work.  It’s important that you follow the instructions in each assignment and type in required files and resources with the proper names. All names are case sensitive, so a name like ""Web1"" is not the same as ""web1"". If you misspell a name, use the wrong case, or put a file in the wrong directory location you will lose points on your assignment. This is the easiest way to lose points, and also the most preventable. You should always double-check your work to make sure it accurately reflects the requirements specified in the assignment. You should always carefully review the content of your files before submitting your assignment.  The assignment Let’s get started!  Create GitHub repository The first step in the assignment is to setup a Git repository on GitHub. We will use a special solution called GitHub Classroom for this course which automates the process of setting up student assignment repositories.  Here are the basic steps:  Click on the following link to open Assignment 2 on the GitHub Classroom site: https://classroom.github.com/a/K4zcVmX- (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.  Click on the Accept this assignment button.  GitHub Classroom will provide you with a URL (https) to access the assignment repository. Either copy this address to your clipboard or write it down somewhere. You will need to use this address to set up the repository on a Linux server.  Example: https://github.com/UST-SEIS665/hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<your github id>.git At this point your new repository to ready to use. The repository is currently empty. We will put some content in there soon!  Launch Linux server The second step in the assignment is to launch a Linux server using AWS EC2. The server should have the following characteristics:  Amazon Linux 2 AMI 64-bit (usually the first option listed)  Located in a U.S. region (us-east-1)  t2.micro instance type  All default instance settings (storage, vpm, security group, etc.)  I’ve shown you how to launch EC2 instances in class. You can review it on Canvas.  Once you launch the new server, it may take a few minutes to provision.  Log into server The next step is to log into the Linux server using a terminal program with a secure shell (SSH) support. You can use iTerm2 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. on a Mac and GitBash/PuTTY (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. on a PC.  You will need to have the private server key and the public IP address before attempting to log into the server. The server key is basically your password. If you lose it, you will need to terminate the existing instance and launch a new server. I recommend reusing the same key when launching new servers throughout the class. Note, I make this recommendation to make the learning process easier and not because it is a common security practice.  I’ve shown you how to use a terminal application to log into the instance using a Windows desktop. Your personal computer or lab computer may be running a different OS version, but the process is still very similar. You can review the videos on the Canvas.  Working with Linux If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You’ve made it over the toughest hurdle. By the end of this course, I promise you will be able to launch and log into servers in your sleep.  You should be looking at a login screen that looks something like this:  Last login: Mon Mar 21 21:17:54 2016 from 174-20-199-194.mpls.qwest.net  __|  __|_  )  _|  (     /   Amazon Linux AMI ___|\___|___| https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2015.09-release-notes/ 8 package(s) needed for security, out of 17 available Run ""sudo yum update"" to apply all updates. ec2-user@ip-172-31-15-26 ~]$ Your terminal cursor is sitting at the shell prompt, waiting for you to type in your first command. Remember the shell? It is a really cool program that lets you start other programs and manage services on the Linux system. The rest of this assignment will be spent working with the shell.  Note, when you are asked to type in a command in the steps below, don’t type in the dollar-sign ($) character. This is just meant to represent the command prompt. The actual commands are represented by the characters to the right of the command prompt.  Let’s start by asking the shell for some help. Type in:  $ help The shell provides you with a list of commands you can run along with possible command options.  Next, check out one of the pages in the built-in manual:  $ man ls A man page will appear with information on how to use the ls command. This command is used to list the contents of file directories. Either space through the contents of the man page or hit q to exit.  Most of the core Linux commands have man pages available. But honestly, some of these man pages are a bit hard to understand. Sometimes your best bet is to search on Google if you are trying to figure out how to use a specific command.  When you initially log into Linux, the system places you in your home directory. Each user on the system has a separate home directory. Let’s see where your home directory is located:  $ pwd The response should be /home/ec2-user. The pwd command is handy to remember if you ever forget what file directory you are currently located in. If you recall from the Linux Hands-on Guide, this directory is also your current working directory.  Type in:  $ cd / The cd command let’s you change to a new working directory on the server. In this case, we changed to the root (/) directory. This is the parent of all the other directories on the file system.  Type in:  $ ls The ls command lists the contents of the current directory. As you can see, root directory contains many other directories. You will become familiar with these directories over time.  The ls command provides a very basic directory listing. You need to supply the command with some options if you want to see more detailed information.  Type in:  $ ls -la See how this command provides you with much more detailed information about the files and directories? You can use this detailed listing to see the owner, group, and access control list settings for each file or directory. Do you see any files listed? Remember, the first character in the access control list column denotes whether a listed item is a file or a directory.  You probably see a couple files with names like .autofsck. How come you didn’t see this file when you typed in the lscommand without any options? (Try to run this command again to convince yourself.) Files names that start with a period are called hidden files. These files won’t appear on normal directory listings.  Type in:  $ cd /var Then, type in:  $ ls You will see a directory listing for the /var directory. Next, type in:  $ ls .. Huh. This directory listing looks the same as the earlier root directory listing. When you use two periods (..) in a directory path that means you are referring to the parent directory of the current directory. Just think of the two dots as meaning the directory above the current directory.  Now, type in:  $ cd ~ $ pwd Whoa. We’re back at our home directory again. The tilde character (~) is another one of those handy little directory path shortcuts. It always refers to our personal home directory. Keep in mind that since every user has their own home directory, the tilde shortcut will refer to a unique directory for each logged-in user.  Most students are used to navigating a file system by clicking a mouse in nested graphical folders. When they start using a command-line to navigate a file system, they sometimes get confused and lose track of their current position in the file system. Remember, you can always use the pwd command to quickly figure out what directory you are currently working in.  Let’s make some changes to the file system. We can easily make our own directories on the file system. Type:  mkdir test Now type:  ls Cool, there’s our new test directory. Let’s pretend we don’t like that directory name and delete it. Type:  rmdir test Now it’s gone. How can you be sure? You should know how to check to see if the directory still exists at this point. Go ahead and check.  Let’s create another directory. Type in:  $ mkdir documents Next, change to the new directory:  $ cd documents Did you notice that your command prompt displays the name of the current directory? Something like: [ec2-user@ip-172-31-15-26 documents]$. Pretty handy, huh?  Okay, let’s create our first file in the documents directory. This is just an empty file for training purposes. Type in:  $ touch paper.txt Check to see that the new file is in the directory. Now, go back to the previous directory. Remember the double dot shortcut?  $ cd .. Okay, we don’t like our documents directory any more. Let’s blow it away. Type in:  $ rmdir documents Uh oh. The shell didn’t like that command because the directory isn’t empty. Let’s change back into the documents directory. But this time don’t type in the full name of the directory. You can let shell auto-completion do the typing for you. Type in the first couple characters of the directory name and then hit the tab key:  $ cd doc<tab> You should use the tab auto-completion feature often. It saves typing and makes working with the Linux file system much much easier. Tab is your friend.  Now, remove the file by typing:  $ rm paper.txt Did you try to use the tab key instead of typing in the whole file name? Check to make sure the file was deleted from the directory.  Next, create a new file:  $ touch file1 We like file1 so much that we want to make a backup copy. Type:  $ cp file1 file1-backup Check to make sure the new backup copy was created. We don’t really like the name of that new file, so let’s rename it. Type:  $ mv file1-backup backup Moving a file to the same directory and giving it a new name is basically the same thing as renaming it. We could have moved it to a different directory if we wanted.  Let’s list all of the files in the current directory that start with the letter f:  $ ls f* Using wildcard pattern matching in file commands is really useful if you want the command to impact or filter a group of files. Now, go up one directory to the parent directory (remember the double dot shortcut?)  We tried to remove the documents directory earlier when it had files in it. Obviously that won’t work again. However, we can use a more powerful command to destroy the directory and vanquish its contents. Behold, the all powerful remove command:  $ rm -fr documents Did you remember to use auto-completion when typing in documents? This command and set of options forcibly removes the directory and its contents. It’s a dangerous command wielded by the mightiest Linux wizards. Okay, maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration. Just be careful with it.  Check to make sure the documents directory is gone before proceeding.  Let’s continue. Change to the directory /var and make a directory called test.  Ugh. Permission denied. We created this darn Linux server and we paid for it. Shouldn’t we be able to do anything we want on it? You logged into the system as a user called ec2-user. While this user can create and manage files in its home directory, it cannot change files all across the system. At least it can’t as a normal user. The ec2-user is a member of the root group, so it can escalate its privileges to super-user status when necessary. Let’s try it:  $ sudo mkdir test Check to make sure the directory exists now. Using sudo we can execute commands as a super-user. We can do anything we want now that we know this powerful new command.  Go ahead and delete the test directory. Did you remember to use sudo before the rmdir command? Check to make sure the directory is gone.  You might be asking yourself the question: why can we list the contents of the /var directory but not make changes? That’s because all users have read access to the /var directory and the ls command is a read function. Only the root users or those acting as a super-user can write changes to the directory.  Let’s go back to our home directory:  $ cd ~ Editing text files is a really common task on Linux systems because many of the application configuration files are text files. We can create a text file by using a text editor. Type in:  $ nano myfile.conf The shell starts up the nano text editor and places your terminal cursor in the editing screen. Nano is a simple text-based word processor. Type in a few lines of text. When you’re done writing your novel, hit ctrl-x and answer y to the prompt to save your work. Finally, hit enter to save the text to the filename you specified.  Check to see that your file was saved in the directory. You can take a look at the contents of your file by typing:  $ cat myfile.conf The cat command displays your text file content on the terminal screen. This command works fine for displaying small text files. But if your file is hundreds of lines long, the content will scroll down your terminal screen so fast that you won’t be able to easily read it. There’s a better way to view larger text files. Type in:  $ less myfile.conf The less command will page the display of a text file, allowing you to page through the contents of the file using the space bar. Your text file is probably too short to see the paging in action though. Hit q to quit out of the less text viewer.  Hit the up-arrow key on your keyboard a few times until the commmand nano myfile.conf appears next to your command prompt. Cool, huh? The up-arrow key allows you to replay a previously run command. Linux maintains a list of all the commands you have run since you logged into the server. This is called the command history. It’s a really useful feature if you have to re-run a complex command again.  Now, hit ctrl-c. This cancels whatever command is displayed on the command line.  Type in the following command to create a couple empty files in the directory:  $ touch file1 file2 file3 Confirm that the files were created. Some commands, like touch. allow you to specify multiple files as arguments. You will find that Linux commands have all kinds of ways to make tasks more efficient like this.  Throughout this assignment, we have been running commands and viewing results on the terminal screen. The screen is the standard place for commands to output results. It’s known as the standard out (stdout). However, it’s really useful to output results to the file system sometimes. Type in:  $ ls > listing.txt Take a look at the directory listing now. You just created a new file. View the contents of the listing.txt file. What do you see? Instead of sending the output from the ls command to the screen we sent it to a text file.  Let’s try another one. Type:  $ cat myfile.conf > listing.txt Take a look at the contents of the listing.txt file again. It looks like your myfile.conf file now. It’s like you made a copy of it. But what happened to the previous content in the listing.txt file? When you redirect the output of a command using the right angle-bracket character (>), the output overwrites the existing file. Type this command in:  $ cat myfile.conf >> listing.txt Now look at the contents of the listing.txt file. You should see your original content displayed twice. When you use two angle-bracket characters in the commmand the output appends (or adds to) the file instead of overwriting it.  We redirected the output from a command to a text file. It’s also possible to redirect the input to a command. Typically we use a keyboard to provide input, but sometimes it makes more sense to input a file to a command. For example, how many words are in your new listing.txt file? Let’s find out. Type in:  $ wc -w < listing.txt Did you get a number? This command inputs the listing.txt file into a word count program called wc.  Type in the command:  $ ls /usr/bin The terminal screen probably scrolled quickly as filenames flashed by. The /usr/bin directory holds quite a few files. It would be nice if we could page through the contents of this directory. Well, we can. We can use a special shell feature called pipes. In previous steps, we redirected I/O using the file system. Pipes allow us to redirect I/O between programs. We can redirect the output from one program into another. Type in:  $ ls /usr/bin | less Now the directory listing is paged. Hit the spacebar to page through the listing. The pipe, represented by a vertical bar character (|), takes the output from the ls command and redirects it to the less command where the resulting output is paged. Pipes are super powerful and used all the time by savvy Linux operators.  Hit the q key to quit the paginated directory listing command.  Working with shell scripts Now things are going to get interesting.  We’ve been manually typing in commands throughout this exercise. If we were running a set of repetitive tasks, we would want to automate the process as much as possible. The shell makes it really easy to automate tasks using shell scripts. The shell provides many of the same features as a basic procedural programming language. Let’s write some code.  Type in this command:  $ j=123 $ echo $j We just created a variable named j referencing the string 123. The echo command printed out the value of the variable. We had to use a dollar sign ($) when referencing the variable in another command.  Next, type in:  $ j=1+1 $ echo $j Is that what you expected? The shell just interprets the variable value as a string. It’s not going to do any sort of computation.  Typing in shell script commands on the command line is sort of pointless. We want to be able to create scripts that we can run over-and-over. Let’s create our first shell script.  Use the nano editor to create a file named myscript. When the file is open in the editor, type in the following lines of code:  #!/bin/bash echo Hello $1 Now quit the editor and save your file. We can run our script by typing:  $ ./myscript World Er, what happened? Permission denied. Didn’t we create this file? Why can’t we run it? We can’t run the script file because we haven’t set the execute permission on the file. Type in:  $ chmod u+x myscript This modifies the file access control list to allow the owner of the file to execute it. Let’s try to run the command again. Hit the up-arrow key a couple times until the ./myscript World command is displayed and hit enter.  Hooray! Our first shell script. It’s probably a bit underwhelming. No problem, we’ll make it a little more complex. The script took a single argument called World. Any arguments provided to a shell script are represented as consecutively numbered variables inside the script ($1, $2, etc). Pretty simple.  You might be wondering why we had to type the ./ characters before the name of our script file. Try to type in the command without them:  $ myscript World Command not found. That seems a little weird. Aren’t we currently in the directory where the shell script is located? Well, that’s just not how the shell works. When you enter a command into the shell, it looks for the command in a predefined set of directories on the server called your PATH. Since your script file isn’t in your special path, the shell reports it as not found. By typing in the ./ characters before the command name you are basically forcing the shell to look for your script in the current directory instead of the default path.  Create another file called cleanup using nano. In the file editor window type:  #!/bin/bash # My cleanup script mkdir archive mv file* archive Exit the editor window and save the file. Change the permissions on the script file so that you can execute it. Now run the command:  $ ./cleanup Take a look at the file directory listing. Notice the archive directory? List the contents of that directory. The script automatically created a new directory and moved three files into it. Anything you can do manually at a command prompt can be automated using a shell script.  Let’s create one more shell script. Use nano to create a script called namelist. Here is the content of the script:  #!/bin/bash # for-loop test script names='Jason John Jane' for i in $names do   echo Hello $i done Change the permissions on the script file so that you can execute it. Run the command:  $ ./namelist The script will loop through a set of names stored in a variable displaying each one. Scripts support several programming constructs like for-loops, do-while loops, and if-then-else. These building blocks allow you to create fairly complex scripts for automating tasks.  Installing packages and services We’re nearing the end of this assignment. But before we finish, let’s install some new software packages on our server. The first thing we should do is make sure all the current packages installed on our Linux server are up-to-date. Type in:  $ sudo yum update -y This is one of those really powerful commands that requires sudo access. The system will review the currently installed packages and go out to the Internet and download appropriate updates.  Next, let’s install an Apache web server on our system. Type in:  $ sudo yum install httpd -y Bam! You probably never knew that installing a web server was so easy. We’re not going to actually use the web server in this exercise, but we will in future assignments.  We installed the web server, but is it actually running? Let’s check. Type in:  $ sudo service httpd status Nope. Let’s start it. Type:  $ sudo service httpd start We can use the service command to control the services running on the system. Let’s setup the service so that it automatically starts when the system boots up. Type in:  $ sudo chkconfig httpd on Cool. We installed the Apache web server on our system, but what other programs are currently running? We can use the pscommand to find out. Type in:  $ ps -ax Lots of processes are running on our system. We can even look at the overall performance of our system using the topcommand. Let’s try that now. Type in:  $ top The display might seem a little overwhelming at first. You should see lots of performance information displayed including the cpu usage, free memory, and a list of running tasks.  We’re almost across the finish line. Let’s make sure all of our valuable work is stored in a git repository. First, we need to install git. Type in the command:  $ sudo yum install git -y Check your work It’s very important to check your work before submitting it for grading. A misspelled, misplaced or missing file will cost you points. This may seem harsh, but the reality is that these sorts of mistakes have consequences in the real world. For example, a server instance could fail to launch properly and impact customers because a single required file is missing.  Here is what the contents of your git repository should look like before final submission:  ┣archive ┃  ┣ file1 ┃  ┣ file2 ┃  ┗ file3 ┣ namelist ┗ myfile.conf  Saving our work in the git repository Next, make sure you are still in your home directory (/home/ec2-user). We will install the git repository you created at the beginning of this exercise. You will need to modify this command by typing in the GitHub repository URL you copied earlier.  $ git clone <your GitHub URL here>.git Example: git clone https://github.com/UST-SEIS665/hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<your github id>.git The git application will ask you for your GitHub username and password. Note, if you have multi-factor authentication enabled on your GitHub account you will need to provide a personal token instead of your password.  Git will clone (copy) the repository from GitHub to your Linux server. Since the repository is empty the clone happens almost instantly. Check to make sure that a sub-directory called ""hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username>"" exists in the current directory (where <username> is your GitHub account name). Git automatically created this directory as part of the cloning process.  Change to the hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> directory and type:  $ ls -la Notice the .git hidden directory? This is where git actually stores all of the file changes in your repository. Nothing is actually in your repository yet.  Change back to the parent directory (cd ..). Next, let’s move some of our files into the repository. Type:  $ mv archive hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> $ mv namelist hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> $ mv myfile.conf hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> Hopefully, you remembered to use the auto-complete function to reduce some of that typing. Change to the hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> directory and list the directory contents. Your files are in the working directory, but are not actually stored in the repository because they haven’t been committed yet.  Type in:  $ git status You should see a list of untracked files. Let’s tell git that we want these files tracked. Type in:  $ git add * Now type in the git status command again. Notice how all the files are now being tracked and are ready to be committed. These files are in the git staging area. We’ll commit them to the repository next. Type:  $ git commit -m 'assignment 2 files' Next, take a look at the commit log. Type:  $ git log You should see your commit listed along with an assigned hash (long string of random-looking characters).  Finally, let’s save the repository to our GitHub account.

qixuanHou/Mapping-My-Break,"Please Read Me First. This is a set of java file of my final version of electronic artifacts. This is a game to map my experience in Disney World, in Orlando during this spring break.   However, because of my limited skills in computer science, I really have no idea how to simplify the process to run the game. Sorry for the inconvenience.   In order to run the game, you may need to install JAVA. I hope the following links will help you.     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk     http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~simpkins/teaching/gatech/cs1331/guides/install-java.html  My main file is called Disney. You can call Disney in console to start the game. However, I failed to putting all the things inside Disney file. Therefore, you may also need to call AdventureLand, MainStreet, and FrontierLand to start other three games.   I hope this will help you. Sorry again for the inconvenience.     1. the structure of my project   My project only focused on my trip in Magic Kingdom, one part of Disney world in Orlando. It is a game which guides players to choose from six sub-games, which match six sections of the park, Main Street U.S.A, Tomorrowland, Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland and Liberty Square. I chose one of the rides I took in each section which, from my perspective, shows what I found interesting in Disney world. I changed what I experienced in the park into a small computer game. I want to share my experience with others while they play my games. In the following part of self reflection, I explain the background, rules and other things about each game. For convenience of matching them, I use different color to mark different parts. I hope it will help readers a little bit when they are lost in my disordered reflections.   1. the hall of presidents - Liberty Square   2. Festivall parade - Fantasyland (I explain this one in the part of technology skill limitations)   3. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad - Frontierland   4.talking with Woody- Adventureland    5. Stitch Store - Tomorrowland      6. lunch time - Main Street USA      3. my reflection of the trip in Disney World  from dream to reality    When I exited Disney resort, I found a sign along the street welcomed people back to real world. Actually, when I was in Orlando, I couldn't believe as an adult, people can mess up fantasy world in the theme parks and the real world. Nevertheless, I felt I was still in fantasy world, when I dreamed twice that I fought for the key to open the door of future. As is known to all, while sleeping, people always dream about what people thinks in the daytime. Therefore, my dream shows that my mind still stayed in the world with Mickey and Donald.    I believe that it is experiencing fantasy world which is the source of the greatest happiness people get from theme park. On the one hand, everybody has pressure in real life especially for adults. They can get out of pressure for a day trip in theme park. They can experience different lives here with cartoon characters. On the other hand, sometimes, it is a really hard task to fulfill some dreams, such as being a princess. However, in Disney world, you can dress up the same as Snow White, waiting for your prince; you can go to space by rocket; you can also travel all over the world in one day and enjoy the food of each country. These are all the magic of theme parks.    Therefore, in my game, I learnt the way which Disney design their rides to focus on the background story of the game instead of the game itself. For example, there is a ride called Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which streaks through a haunted gold-mining town aboard a rollicking runaway mine train. The views around the ride were like a gold mining town. There were tools for gold-mining around the railroad and the railroad looked like very old. In order to show riders that it was a haunted gold-mining town, the train always took a sudden turn or speed up quickly to scare people.    I decided to name one of my game, which was inspired by this ride, the same name, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Instead of sitting inside the mine train to travel around the haunted town, mine was for users to use keyboard to control the train to travel around the gridding railroad. I place traps inside several parts of gridding to ""scare"" players, who cannot know where traps are until they get into them. If I know how to use animation, I will show scary pictures when players drive their train to the traps. Unlike the ride in Disney, my players can no longer travel once they encounter a trap because their train may have some problems to keep moving. Also, the main goal in the game is to find the gold. However, as we know, finding gold is really hard. Therefore, players must go to find Aladdin's Wonderful lamp where also places inside the gridding while players cannot see its exact place until they happen to drive inside the part where lamp is. Aladdin's Wonderful lamp will show players the map of the gold and when people get to the gold mine, they win. However, there is another limitation of the game. Haunted town is so dangerous during the night. Therefore, players only have 12 hours to finish the task. Train can drive one square in 20 min. Therefore, train can only move 36 times or they will also be caught by traps.    In this game, I want to show audiences I have a background story like rides in Disney World. Players need to find the gold in a haunted gold-mining town. Also, in order to show the relationship with Disney, I use Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp as the guide for the players, which is a well known characters in Disney cartoon.    I created another game, called talking with Woody to show the magic power of Disney characters. There are a lot of chances to meet Disney characters in Disney world. On the one hand, travelers, especially small kids, are really excited to meet the characters they watched on TV. I think some kids may believe they take pictures with real Mickey Mouse. On the hand, staffs in Disney who wear the costumes are really tired. It was hot in Orlando last week, but all costumes were very heavy. I was moved by the staffs inside Mickey. They also need to mimic the actions of characters and also need to show kindness and warmness to children. It seems like a really hard job. Therefore, I decide to show this part of Disney in my project as well. I decided to use Woody, a toy all the toys look up to. He is smart, kind and brave like a cowboy should be. He is more than a top, he is friend to everyone enjoying the movie Toy. In order to create an interactive game, I planned to ask players to guide Woody. Players need to call Woody before their instructions. For instance, if players say (actually players are typing) ""Woody, please sit down"", Woody will sit down (actually, there will be another line on the screen showing the same as players import). However, if players are rude and just say ""sit down"" without calling Woody, Woody won't act (actually there is just nothing showing up on the screen).  great facilities to provide convenience to everyone   The facilities to satisfy needs for special groups of people, like small kids or disabled people, are well developed. In the past in China, it seemed impossible for parents to take infants and small kids to travel. The road is not flat or wide enough for strollers or wheelchairs. However, in Disney world, everything seemed like well prepared for everyone to use.   There are strollers rentals, and electric conveyance vehicles rentals, which are available to rent throughout Disney world. There are baby care center for mothers to feed, change and nurse little ones. There are locker rentals for storing personal items. There are also hearing disability services which have sign language interpretation to help disabled people to enjoy fantasy world. There are still a lot other convenient services in Disney world. I think the purpose of these services show the pursue of equality among everyone in the world. On the one hand, I am really touched by the availability of these services here. It seems Disney try its best to service everyone who have desire to experience fantasy land. On the other hand, in this way, Disney can attract more travelers in order to make more money in some ways.    Also, in Disney, it seems like a tradition that there are stores at the exit of the famous rides. Somebody may think it is just a strategy to make people shopping a lot. However, I think it also provides some convenience that travelers can buy souvenirs where is memorable. For example, when I finished my trip in Escape Stitch, I entered a store with a lot of kinds of Stitch, like Stitch pillow, Stitch key chain and so on. I really want to buy something in order to remind me the wonderful feelings. Therefore, I showed my opinion inside my game as well. I wrote one part is for shopping. The items are different kinds of Stitch. My codes can act as a robot to help customers to shop in the store.    There are a lot of restaurants in Disney. Maps of Disney are full of restaurants' name. The greatest things about the food are in Epcot, I experienced different counties in one day. I felt like I was in fast travel in different parts of the world and tasted their special food and snacks while I was on the way. I remembered I was still eating Japanese food when I was in ""Mexico"". It was a great experience. However, there were always a long waiting lines for the all restaurants. People needed to reserve a table a day before their trip and even they had the reservation, they still needed to wait for a long time. I think Disney may need some good ways to fix the problems of waiting for a long time. I have no idea of changing the situation of restaurants, but I think if there are robots to customers to order in fast food restaurant, it may help a lot. Thus, I have another code to customers to order in Plaza Restaurant. If this kind of robots can work in the real life, people can order by themselves and there will be more staffs available to prepare food.    theme park uses interesting ways to teach knowledge of boring topics   Theme part is also a great source of learning knowledge, especially for kids. They use Disney characters, interesting shows, or even games to teach useful things. The ways change the boring knowledge to interesting things, which always attract children's attention.    The most amazing one was an interactive game in Epcot's Innoventions, called ""where's the fire?"", which teaches adults and children basic fire safety in a fun and entertaining way. About every five minutes, the players waiting in line are divided into two groups and move into the home's entry. Here, a host will explain the object of the game and lay out the rules. The scenario is this: you are on a mission to discover a number of fire hazards commonly found around the house. To do this, you move from room to room, looking for potential risks. To help in the task, each player is given a special ""safely light"" to help uncover lurking dangers. The rooms are large projection screens. When a hazard is discovered, all persons in the room must shine their safety light on the same spot. when they do, the hazard is rendered harmless and points are assigned. After playing in the game to find the hazardous things in the house, I learned a lot of safety tips. It is much easier to remember the tips I learned during the game than those I learned on textbook or internet. I believe kids will enjoy the games and learn from them as well.    I also tried to show this reflection in my project. Thus, I planned to make a game, called the hall of presidents, which test people's knowledge of presidents in USA. However, I failed to achieve the goal of making it an entertaining game instead of a quiz. My game was still like a quiz. However, because it is the only code which can work well inside my big game. I decide to still hold the game for my projects in order to what my original ideas are.   4. technology skill limitations    I feel terribly sorry for my limited skills in CS. It is my first time to learn JAVA this semester. I just begin to learn the core concepts of JAVA this month. When I choose to use java code for this project, I know I will face plentiful limitations and problems. Here I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Johnson, who encouraged me not to give up my ideas.   To be honest, I have no idea of how to change a java code into a real game with animations. I know the background story of the game is more important for English course and pictures are the best way to show the background, but I have no idea to show all these things by JAVA coding. Therefore, I choose to use videos for my presentation. In this way, I can show my animation inside the videos while the code clue of my game is still composed by JAVA coding. Also, video gives me a lot of freedom when choose my contents for presentation. I can explain a lot details of my project clearly through videos.    For example, I found the festival parade in the magic kingdom was great and I wanted to share the experience in my project by showing the pictures or videos. However, because of the technology limitations, I can only show the videos in my presentations. Also, I mistakenly deleted my videos which I shot on my trip Orlando, I can only share others' parade show......   Also, I want to apologize for the incompleteness of my game. I only dedicated to writing codes for Magic Kingdom, a part of my trip during spring break. Writing codes is a really time consuming task for me. In general, I need to spend more than eight hours to finish one project for my CS assignment this semester. While for this project, the final artifacts are composed of several parts of codes and in the end I need to write the father code in order to take care of my code family for spring break. Due to my limitation in writing codes, I can only finish one part of Disney world. However, I think my code shows all my reflections and perspectives during my trip, even though it looks like it only shows one part of my trip.    The terrible mistake I made is that I found out the most of my codes I wrote had significant errors on Tuesday. I went to CS TA office for help, while the errors were still impossible to fix in order to achieve the goal I planned to get. Consequently, my game have to be separated into several parts. Instead of a big game having others as sub-games inside the big one, my final artifacts are composed by several small games. I need to start them one by one. It may cause some inconvenience for players to map their trip in Disney world.",26,Java,10,https://github.com/qixuanHou/Mapping-My-Break,2016-01-25 18:23:19+00:00,2024-09-04 07:47:38+00:00

Devtown-India/HandsOn-Data-Analysis-and-ML,"Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.  Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.  In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.   Day:1  In this project, Students will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. They will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics. Technologies that will be covered are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter notebook. We will be giving the students a deep dive into the Data Analytical process   Day:2  We will be giving the students an insight into one of the major fields of Machine Learning ie. Time Series forcasting we will be taking them through the relevant theory and make them understand of the importance and different techniques that are available to deal with it. After that we will be working hands on the bike share data set implementing different algorithms and understanding them to the core    We aim to provide students an insight into what exactly is the job of a data analyst and get them familiarise to how does the entire data analysis process work.

Others can use the left/right nav arrows or mouse drag.  It uses CSS3 Transitions for animations but falls back to jQuery animations for browsers without CSS3 Transition support. The code has been heavily optimized to avoid page reflows (faster, more responsive experience for the user).  It even plays nicely with the lazyLoad.js plugin.  Even though it is a jQuery UI widget, the cost in bytes is reasonable since you don't need the entire UI library, just core and widget.

Anjulcodewiz/Pharmacy-management-system,"INTRODUCTION: The main aim of the project is the management of the database of the pharmaceutical shop. This project is insight into the design and implementation of a Pharmacy Management System. This is done by creating a database of the available medicines in the shop. The primary aim of pharmacy management system is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. The aim of this project is to develop software for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. We have developed this software for ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock.  Description on the topic: This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shops having a database to maintain. The software used can generate reports, as per the user’s requirements. The software can print invoices, bills, receipts etc. It can also maintain the record of supplies sent in by the supplier. Here, the admin who are handling the organization will be responsible to manage the record of the employee. Each employee will be given with a separate username and password.  Problem Definition: The aim of the project is to create an effective software to help the pharmacist to maintain the records of the medicines, handle user details, generate invoice, check and renew validity and provide a scope of communication between users by using inbuilt messaging system. Pharmacy management system deals with the maintenance of drugs and consumables in the pharmacy unit. This pharmacy management system is user friendly.  Objectives -> Primary objective •To gain practical experience by modeling a software based on real world problem. •To understand how to work on Front-end (Java) and Back-end (MySQL) by using server(wamp).  -> Secondary objective •To develop an application that deals with the day to day requirement of any pharmacy. •To develop the easy management of the medicines (drugs). •To handle the inventory details like sales details, purchase details and stock expiry and quantity. •To provide competitive advantage to the pharmacy. •To provide details information about the stock on details necessary and help locate it in shop easily. •To make the stock manageable and simplify the use of inventory in the pharmacy.  Hardware and software tools: The system services and goals are established by consultation with system user. They are then defined in details and serve as a system specification. System requirement are those on which the system runs.   ⚙️ Hardware Requirements: o Computer with either Intel Pentium processor or AMD processor. o 1GB+ DDR RAM o 40GB hard disk drive  💻 Software Requirements: o Windows/ MacOS/ Linux operating system. o JRE and JDK. o MySQL server (WAMP or XAMPP or any)  Chapter 2 - DESIGN Database Design is a collection of processes that facilitate the designing, development, implementation and maintenance of enterprise data management systems. It helps produce database systems: o That meet the requirements of the users o Have high performance.   Architecture Description The design of a DBMS depends on its architecture. It can be centralized or decentralized or hierarchical. The architecture of a DBMS can be seen as either single tier or multi-tier.  ER Diagram  image.png  Fig 1: ER Diagram  An entity–relationship model describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge (Refer Fig 1). It is composed of entity types and specifies relationships that can exist between instances of those entity types.  Relational Schema Diagram  image_1.png  Fig 2: Relational Schema  Relational schema is a collection of meta-data. Database schema describes the structure and constraints of data representing in a particular domain (Refer Fig 2).  Chapter 3 - IMPLEMENTATION Description on Implementation The goal of this application is to manage the medicines and various function of the pharmacy.  List of modules: o Login page o Home page o Company o Purchase o Drugs o Sales o User/Settings o Messaging  Chapter 4 - Result and Discussion By using MySQL commands and its database this website Pharmacy management tends to store all the data received from the users including drugs sales details and the profit made by the owners are all in this data base. This website allows the user to generate invoices for sales, check expiry and quantity remaining of the drugs. It also provides user with options to renew validity and add more drugs into the store and update the database accordingly. By using xampp server these database commands are easily initiated into the database and the ER diagram with relational schema diagrams helps us to make the structure of the database faster and it was easier to make them understand the needs of the website.  Login Information  id :1 password: admin   CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE SCOPE o Detailed information gathering has to be done. Without that the purpose for using the software won’t be satisfied properly. o However, it can give good profits in the long run. o Implementing the software requires change in the business practices. o Efficient organization of all knowledge is the analysis company and easy analysis access and retrieval of information is possible. o In this project we can also include BAR CODE facility using the bar code reader, which will detect the expiry date and the other information about the related medicines. o Company using this software will always be able to plan in future and always be aware of their financial position in the market. o It leads to ease in functioning of business processes. o The project can be made more robust by including biometric verification. o There is also a scope to expand by implementing newer technologies like cloud etcetera.",18,,5,https://github.com/Anjulcodewiz/Pharmacy-management-system,2021-11-17 13:40:55+00:00,2024-09-14 01:52:29+00:00

Categories can be nested indefinitely. Creating, deleting and editing of categories is handled in admin panel.  Detailed home page There is placeholder text on the home page at the moment that will represent most important features of your marketplace. On top of that, all users can see Top Vendors (Vendors with most sales), Latest Orders (Products of orders completed most recently, as well as order value, but no information about buyer or seller), Rising Vendors (Vendors with most sales in specified time frame, defaults to 7 days). Official mirrors is place where you can specify on what other links your website can be reached.  Password reset Password can be reseted with PGP Key added on account (more about PGP below) or with Mnemonic key provided during signup. Mnemonic key is shown only once and should be written down on paper. During signup it is hashed (bcrypt) instantly and only stored in operating memory for the short time during display after which is cleared from memory manually as addition to automatic PHP Garbage Collection.  PGP Each user can add their on PGP key which is used for multiple features. Vendors must have PGP and 2FA enabled before they are allowed to upgrade from user to vendor status. If you have active PGP key you can reset your password with it or enable 2FA for your login. Each PGP key must be confirmed before is linked to account, and if you want to add new key you must first sign a message from the old one. Messages can also be encrypted with user’s PGP key if its present (this is not enforced, its user’s choice).  2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)  If user has PGP key linked to their account, they can enable 2FA. If enabled, login to marketplace will be prevented unless randomly generated message is signed from the key.  Wishlist  Buyers do not need to save product links for later. On each product there is “Add to wishlist” button that can be used, and they are stored in user’s personal list for later.  Vendors  Normal users cannot post products on Marketplace. In order to post products you must become vendor. Before you can upgrade you must have PGP key and 2FA Enabled in your profile. Vendor price can be set in marketplace config. Vendor can use any of the coins available to purchase vendor status. Out of each vendor sale, a percentage of sale value goes to marketplace addresses.  Vendor profile customization  Vendors are able to customize their profile with pre-defined profile backgrounds and short personal description.  Vendor levels and XP  Each new vendor starts at Level 0 and progresses further based on performance. XP and Amount of levels is dynamic and configurable. Multipliers determine how much XP is granted to/taken from vendors for each action. XP is granted/taken by formula: USDvalue*multiplier Example: product_delivered multiplier is 20 USD value of product is 100$ When vendor successfully delivers product, he will receive 100*20=2000 XP This is example from experience config file:  Code:     ‘multipliers’ => [ ‘product_delivered’ => 10, ‘product_dispute_lost’ =>20, // How much XP per star (given/taken based on feedback type) ‘feedback_per_star’ => 2, // how much XP per USD value of transaction (given/taken based on feedback type) ‘feedback_per_usd’ => 5, ]  Feedback  After each completed purchase, vendors are able to leave feedback. Feedback types are Positive, Neutral and Negative and they will affect vendor score as well as product score.  Multiple Coins  Probably the most important system is Coin System. Its completely dynamic, which means new coins can be added at any time. Standard version of marketplace comes with Bitcoin and Monero included. For each coin added, in marketplace config there can be set unlimited amount of marketplace addresses (used for receiving fees from purchases), and in case more than one address is present, address for receiving fee will be choosen randomly (for each purchase).  Product types There are two product types. Physical and Digital products. Based on the type, different options are displayed during product creating and purchase. Both Digital and Physical products support offers and custom units of measure (Item, kg, gram, piece …). With offers, vendors can give discounts on purchase based on quantity. For example: Price for 1 product is 100$ Price for 10 products is 90$ Price for 20+ products is 80$ Each of those is considered an offer and can be added/removed at any time.  Digital products support automatic delivery which is optional. If checked, autofill system is used. Each line in textarea is treated as single item and will be product’s quantity. It will be instantly sent on user upon purchase.  Physical products have delivery options. Each delivery option consists of: Name, Price, Expected delivery duration, Minimum quantity for delivery, Maximum Quantity for delivery. Physical products can also include/exclude countries from shipping.  Markdown styling Instead of just plain text, product description and rules support markdown styling. Every tag is supported except URL tag.  Purchasing  When user chooses to purchase any product, he is able to pay with any coin supported by market (and vendor, since vendors can choose which coins they want on each product). There is no wallets or anything similar. Users do not need to keep money on marketplace at all times. For each purchase random address is generated, and its used for that purchase only.  Escrow  Escrow is present on every purchase by default. Upon purchase, marketplace address is generated that will hold funds. If purchase is completed if its marked as delivered or dispute is resolved. If buyer is unhappy with purchase he can open dispute and potentially (based on admin’s decision) get his money back. Upon purchase completion, based on result money will be sent from temporary purchase address to buyer/vendor and to one of the marketplace holding addresses.  Cart  If user wants to buy more than one product (maybe from different sellers too), they can add them all in a cart and then checkout only once.  Messages  Most important feature of messages is security. Marketplace uses latest algorithms and standards in Public Key Cryptography (like XChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF) to encrypt messages between users. Upon registration, Public and Private keys are created for each user. Based on user’s password an encryption key is derived, and that key is used to encrypt Private key, while Public Key is exposed. When user A whats to send message to user B, a key exchange happens. User A encrypts message with User B’s public key, and that message is stored in database. Only user B can read that message when he logs in and decrypts his messages with password. This system makes messages secure and unreadable by anyone, including marketplace administrator or basically anyone who can possibly get access to the database.  Messages are organized in conversations. Multiple conversations can be started at the same time.  Notifications  Users will get notifications for most actions that happen on marketplace regarding them. Some of the examples are: New message, Purchase status update (product sent, product delivered etc.), Vendor actions (Feedback) and so on. They can be read in User Account Panel and deleted at any time.  Bitmessage  Marketplace can possibly connect to Bitmessage daemon. If connected, users can chose to add their Bitmessage addresses and get their notifications forwarded there. This means they will still get notifications even if they are not currently logged in, and they don’t need to refresh anything. Before being able to forward notifications, Bitmessage addresses must be confirmed first.  JavaScript Warning  Optional warning can be enabled in marketplace config. If visitor has JavaScript enabled, a message will be displayed notifying them about security issues.  Support  Users can open support tickets regarding any problem they encounter. Administrators/Moderators will see this tickets in admin panel and can reply, or close them.  Admin Panel  Most of the stuff happening on marketplace can be viewed directly on admin panel. Administrators can access every feature on admin panel.  Moderators Modular permission system is currently supported, which means admins can give/take some access to moderators (For example, support staff can only answer tickets and resolve disputes, community manager can only send mass messages etc.). Currently supported features:  Index – Basic information  Categories – Add/Edit/Remove Categories  Mass Messages – Ability to send messages to users by marketplace (Can be filtered to user groups)  Users – View users, search, filter, and edit each user individually.  Products – View, search, filter by user, or edit product  Log – Activity log of all Administrators/Moderators inside Admin Panel Example:  Code:  Bitmessage – Status of Bitmessage service (performs test), and view of marketplace bitmessage address  Disputes – View and resolve purchase disputes  Tickets – View and resolve support tickets  Purchases – List of all purchases  Vendor Purchases – List of vendor purchases  Supported coins  Marketplace currently supports these coins:  Bitcoin – Included in standard version  Monero – Included in standard version  Litecoin  DASH  PIVX  Verge  Bitcoin Cash  Installation  Marketplace installation instructions are included. These are not 100% copy paste but they do explain how must of the things work in detail.  Selling terms and conditions:  I’m selling only script, I won’t help you install it,or whatever you want to do after you purchase it  I’m not responsible for anything you do with the files after the purchase  After purchase you cannot resell or share this script  Script is tested for bugs but In case you find any, or any error in code it will be fixed with no additional charge  I will not give you files first in any case. I don’t care who you are, if you don’t trust me we will use escrow  In case of escrow I will deal only with bitcointalk trusted escrow (You can find list here)  Price stated below is for one copy of the script, that means I intend to sell it multiple times. In case you want to be the only buyer please contact me  DEMO LINK  Current price is: 599$ in BTC equivalent (please note that this can be changed at any time) For this price, you get standard version of the marketplace with two coins (Bitcoin and Monero). If you want additional coins, they are charged separately. Litecoin, DASH, PIVX are 50$ each, Verge is 60$ and Bitcoin Cash is 90$",17,,5,https://github.com/saffeh6/blackmarket-script,2020-12-12 17:53:37+00:00,2024-09-28 02:01:41+00:00

BlockchainLabs/Pebblecoin,"Pebblecoin    UPDATE 2015/12/31: Version 0.4.4.1 is now out.  The major change is optimizing the daemon to use less RAM.  It no longer keeps all the blocks, which are rarely needed, in RAM, and so RAM usage has decreased from around 2 gigabytes, to under 200 megabytes.  Mac binaries are also now available.  The new wallet is compatible with the old wallet - simply turn off the old wallet, and start the new wallet, and the blockchain will update automatically to use less RAM.  Code: Release Notes 0.4.4.1 - (All) Fix blockchain RAM usage, from almost 2 GB to less than 200 MB   - Seamless blockchain conversion on first run with new binaries - (Qt) Fix high CPU usage - (Qt) Fix sync indicator (# of total blocks) - (Mac) Mac binaries - Technical Notes:   - (All) Blockchain disk-backed storage with sqlite3 and stxxl   - (Mac) Fix mac compilation   - (All) Update build files & instructions for linux, mac, windows   - (All) Remove unused protobuf and OpenSSL dependencies for Qt wallet   - (Tests) Fix valgrind errors   - (Tests) Use local directory for blockchain instead of default directory   - (Tests) Run tests on Windows if using new enough MSVC  LINKS: Windows 64-bit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b4kubwwnb4t7o4w/pebblecoin-all-win32-x64-v0.4.4.1.zip?dl=0 Mac 64-bit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/uoy9z1oxu4x53cv/pebblecoin-all-mac-x64-v0.4.4.1.tar.gz?dl=0 Linux 64-bit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jq3h3bc29jmndks/pebblecoin-all-linux-x64-v0.4.4.1.tar.gz?dl=0  Exchange: https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_xpb .  Source: https://github.com/xpbcreator/pebblecoin/  CONTACT: xpbcreator@torguard.tg IRC: irc.freenode.net, #pebblecoin   UPDATE 2015/06/08: Version 0.4.3.1 is now out.  This is a minor, mostly bug-fix release.  Work continues on the next major release which will bring us user-created currencies and user-graded contracts. Release notes: Code: Release Notes 0.4.3.1 - RPC calls for DPOS:   - getdelegateinfos RPC call   - get kimageseqs RPC call   - block header contains signing_delegate_id - fix checkpoint rollback bug - fix inability to send coins if voting history was lost   UPDATE 2015/05/04: Version 0.4.2.2 is now out.  This is a bug-fix/cosmetic release.  Release notes: Payment ID support Windows installer Logos updated Improved DPOS tab Sync issues fully fixed Fix rare crash bug Fix min out 0 bug Fix debit display Fix GUI not updating Updated hard-coded seed nodes   UPDATE 2015/04/24: The switch-over to DPOS has succeeded without a hitch!  DPOS blocks are being signed as we speak, at the far faster pace of 15 seconds per block.  This marks the start of a new era for Pebblecoin.   UPDATE 2015/04/21: Congratulations to the first registered delegate!  This indicates the start of the forking change so everybody please update your daemons if you haven't already.    To promote the coin and encourage people to become delegates, we've come up with an incentive scheme.  First, we'll send a free 100 XPB to anybody who PMs me their public address, for people to play around with and to start using the coin.  Second, once DPOS starts, for the first month of DPOS I'll send an extra 0.5 XPB to the signing delegate for every block they process.  This is on top of the usual transaction fees they will receive.  This is to encourage more people to become delegates at this important phase of the coin.   UPDATE 2015/04/19: All went well on the testnet release, so after a few further minor modifications, we are releasing version 0.4.1.2 to the public.  This is a forking change, so please update your clients and servers (links below).  At block 83120, sometime on April 21st, registration for DPOS delegates will begin.  At block 85300, sometime on April 24th, the network will switch over to DPOS.  As with the testnet, to become a delegate and receive block fees for securing the network, just turn on your wallet, register to be a delegate (5 XPB fee), and then leave your wallet on.  It will sign the blocks when it is your turn.  While Roman works on the next phase of the release - introducing subcurrencies - I will be fixing up some loose ends on the wallet, adding payment ID support, etc.  This is truly an exciting time for Pebblecoin.  RELEASE NOTES: All clients adjust internal clocks using ntp (client list in src/common/ntp_time.cpp) Added testnet support DPOS registration starts Block 83120 (~April 21st) DPOS phase starts Block 85300 (~April 24th) Default fee bumped to 0.10 XPB Low-free transactions no longer get relayed by default Significantly improved wallet sync Checkpoint at Block 79000   TOTAL CURRENT COINS: Available at this link. BLOCK TARGET TIME: 2 minutes EXPECTED EMISSION: At Block 3600 (End of Day 5): ~78 XPBs At Block 6480 (End of Day 9): ~758 XPBs At Block 9360 (End of Day 13): 6,771.0 XPBs At Block 12240 (End of Day 17): ~61,000 XPBs At Block 15120 (End of Day 21): ~550,000 XPBs, start of regular 300/block emission At Block 21900 (End of Month 1): ~2,600,000 XPBs, 300/block At Block 43800 (End of Month 2): ~9,150,000 XPBs, 300/block At Block 85300 (End of POW phase): ~21,500,300 XPBs.   UPDATE: The Pebblecoin Pool is now live!   Instructions: Download the linux miner and run it: ./minerd -o stratum+tcp://69.60.113.21:3350 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS -p x   UPDATE: The Pebblecoin wallet is now live!     There have been thousands of attempts at alternative currencies in the community.  Many are 100% copies of existing blockchains with a different name.  Some are very slight variations with no significant differences.  From recent history it is apparent the only realistic chance for viability of a new currency is one that is innovation and continued support and development.  The bitcoin community for good reason has shown interest in currencies that provide privacy of transactions, several currencies such as darkcoin, have become popular based on this desire.  The best technology for privacy is cryptonote although for a variety of reasons there hasnt been much development for ease of use, and as a result there has not been significant adoption.  Pebblecoin (XPB) is a cryptonote based coin with improvements and changes in some areas, and the promise of development in others.  I invite developers to work on this technology with me.  There is no premine, any tips or support of any developer including myself will be completely voluntary.  These are the following areas which I have determined needs changes/updates: I welcome suggestions, and am interested what else I can try to improve.  1) New Mining algorithm (active)  A mining algorithm is either susceptible to ASIC development or to being botnetted, meaning it is either more efficient to have a centralized mining entity (as is the case with bitcoin) or to have an algorithm that requires a real CPU, in which case botnets become very attractive.  To my knowledge there does not exist a blockchain that attempts to solve both problems, by having an algorithm that only works on a general purpose computer and is difficult to botnet.  Cryptonote coins currently are primarily mined with botnets.  Boulderhash is a new mining algorithm requiring 13 GB RAM, nearly eliminating all possible zombie (botnet controlled) computers from mining.  Most infected computers in the world do not have 13 GB available, so an algorithm that requires that much RAM severely limits the productivity of a botnet.  13 GB also makes ASICs cost prohibitive, and the current GPUs do not have that much RAM.  What's left is general purpose computers as was the original intent of bitcoin's mining process.  2) Distribution of coins (active)  It is very common in the launch of a new cryptocurrency the distribution algorithm heavily is weighted towards the very early adopters.  Such distribution is designed to give a massive advantage to people who are fully prepared to mine at launch, with a very large difference shortly after sometimes a few days later.  If the point of mining is to both secure the network and fairly distribute coins a gradual build up of rewards makes more sense, with no drop off in mining rewards.  At a standard block reward of 300, at launch each block will reward 0.3 coins leading up to 3, 30, and finally the standard reward of 300 which will be the standard unchanging reward from that point.  It will take approximately 3 weeks for the block reward of 300 to be reached.  3) GUI Software (active)  There are no current cryptonote coins that have a downloadable GUI, which makes the user experience much worse than that of bitcoin.  It is hard to achieve signficant adoption with a command line interface.  The very first update had the exact GUI written for bitcoin fully working with Pebblecoin.  The GUI was released on Jan 19, before the full 300 XPB reward was awarded for winning the block.  4) IRC Chat support embedded in Client GUI (active)  For user support, and to talk to core developers message boards such as Bitcointalk and reddit are primarily used.  I have embedded an IRC client in the GUI and be available at set hours for any kind of support.   5) Address aliasing (to be worked on)  Just as a user visiting google does not need to know the ip address, similarly an address should have the ability to have an associated userid.  If I ask a friend to send me pebblecoins it would be easier to tell him send it to @myuserid rather than a very long address or scanning a QR code.  There should be a way of registering a userid on the blockchain that will permanently translate to a pebblecoin addresss.   QT INSTRUCTIONS: Download the package for your respective platform Run the Qt executable.  The software will generate a new wallet for you and use a default folder: ~/.pebblecoin on Linux and %appdata%\pebblecoin on Windows. To use an existing wallet, copy the wallet.keys file into the default folder. To use a different data directory and/or wallet file, run the software like so: ./pebblecoin-qt --data-dir <DataDir> --wallet-file <FileName>. To enable mining, run the start_mining_NEEDS_13GB_RAM.bat batch file. Or run the qt wallet with the --enable-boulderhash command line option, or put enable-boulderhash=1 into the config file.  It will start mining to the wallet address.  To change the number of mining threads (13GB required per thread), do --mining-threads <NumThreads> or edit the batch file.  DAEMON + SIMPLEWALLET INSTRUCTIONS: Download the package, run: ./pebblecoind --data-dir pebblecoin_data Once the daemon finished syncing, run the simplewallet: ./simplewallet  POOL INSTRUCTIONS: Download the miner binary for your platform. Run the miner using a wallet address gotten from simplewallet or the Qt Wallet:  Code: minerd -o stratum+tcp://69.60.113.21:3350 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS -p x [/li]   DEV WALLET (for donations): PByFqCfuDRUPVsNrzrUXnuUdF7LpXsTTZXeq5cdHpJDogbJ8EBXopciN7DmQiGhLEo5ArA7dFqGga2A AhbRaZ2gL8jjp9VmYgk",17,,8,https://github.com/BlockchainLabs/Pebblecoin,2016-07-12 15:41:30+00:00,2024-09-30 23:35:31+00:00
SOYJUN/Implement-ODR-protocol,"Overview  For this assignment you will be developing and implementing :  An On-Demand shortest-hop Routing (ODR) protocol for networks of fixed but arbitrary and unknown connectivity, using PF_PACKET sockets. The implementation is based on (a simplified version of) the AODV algorithm.  Time client and server applications that send requests and replies to each other across the network using ODR. An API you will implement using Unix domain datagram sockets enables applications to communicate with the ODR mechanism running locally at their nodes. I shall be discussing the assignment in class on Wednesday, October 29, and Monday, November 3.  The following should prove useful reference material for the assignment :  Sections 15.1, 15.2, 15.4 & 15.6, Chapter 15, on Unix domain datagram sockets.  PF_PACKET(7) from the Linux manual pages. You might find these notes made by a past CSE 533 student useful. Also, the following link http://www.pdbuchan.com/rawsock/rawsock.html contains useful code samples that use PF_PACKET sockets (as well as other code samples that use raw IP sockets which you do not need for this assignment, though you will be using these types of sockets for Assignment 4). Charles E. Perkins & Elizabeth M. Royer. “Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing.” Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications, New Orleans, Louisiana, February 1999,  pp. 90 - 100.  The  VMware  environment  minix.cs.stonybrook.edu is a Linux box running VMware. A cluster of ten Linux virtual machines, called vm1 through vm10, on which you can gain access as root and run your code have been created on minix. See VMware Environment Hosts for further details.  VMware instructions  takes you to a page that explains how to use the system. The ten virtual machines have been configured into a small virtual intranet of Ethernet LANs whose topology is (in principle) unknown to you.  There is a course account cse533 on node minix, with home directory /users/cse533. In there, you will find a subdirectory Stevens/unpv13e , exactly as you are used to having on the cs system. You should develop your source code and makefiles for handing in accordingly. You will be  handing in  your source code on the minix node.  Note that you do not need to link against the socket library (-lsocket) in Linux. The same is true for -lnsl and -lresolv. For example, take a look at how the LIBS variable is defined for Solaris, in /home/courses/cse533/Stevens/unpv13e_solaris2.10/Make.defines (on compserv1, say) :  LIBS = ../libunp.a -lresolv -lsocket -lnsl -lpthread  But if you take a look at Make.defines on minix (/users/cse533/Stevens/unpv13e/Make.defines) you will find only:  LIBS = ../libunp.a -lpthread  The nodes vm1 , . . . . . , vm10 are all multihomed :  each has two (or more) interfaces. The interface  ‘eth0 ’  should be completely ignored and is not to be used for this assignment (because it shows all ten nodes as if belonging to the same single Ethernet 192.168.1.0/24, rather than to an intranet composed of several Ethernets).  Note that vm1 , . . . . . , vm10 are virtual machines, not real ones. One implication of this is that you will not be able to find out what their (virtual) IP addresses are by using nslookup and such. To find out these IP addresses, you need to look at the file /etc/hosts on minix. More to the point, invoking gethostbyname for a given vm will return to you only the (primary) IP address associated with the interface eth0 of that vm (which is the interface you will not be using). It will not return to you any other IP address for the node. Similarly, gethostbyaddr will return the vm node name only if you give it the (primary) IP address associated with the interface eth0 for the node. It will return nothing if you give it any other IP address for the node, even though the address is perfectly valid. Because of this, and because it will ease your task to be able to use gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr in a straightforward way, we shall adopt the (primary) IP addresses associated with interfaces eth0 as the ‘canonical’ IP addresses for the nodes (more on this below).  Time client and server  A time server runs on each of the ten vm machines. The client code should also be available on each vm so that it can be evoked at any of them.  Normally, time clients/servers exchange request/reply messages using the TCP/UDP socket API that, effectively, enables them to receive service (indirectly, via the transport layer) from the local IP mechanism running at their nodes. You are to implement an API using Unix domain sockets to access the local ODR service directly (somewhat similar, in effect, to the way that raw sockets permit an application to access IP directly). Use Unix domain SOCK_DGRAM, rather than SOCK_STREAM, sockets (see Figures 15.5 & 15.6, pp. 418 - 419).  API  You need to implement a msg_send function that will be called by clients/servers to send requests/replies. The parameters of the function consist of : int          giving the socket descriptor for write char*     giving the ‘canonical’ IP address for the destination node, in presentation format int          giving the destination ‘port’ number char*     giving message to be sent int flag  if set, force a route rediscovery to the destination node even if a non-‘stale’ route already exists (see below) msg_send will format these parameters into a single char sequence which is written to the Unix domain socket that a client/server process creates. The sequence will be read by the local ODR from a Unix domain socket that the ODR process creates for itself.  Recall that the ‘canonical’ IP address for a vm node is the (primary) IP address associated with the eth0 interface for the node. It is what will be returned to you by a call to gethostbyname.  Similarly, we need a msg_recv function which will do a (blocking) read on the application domain socket and return with : int       giving socket descriptor for read char*  giving message received char*  giving ‘canonical’ IP address for the source node of message, in presentation format int*     giving source ‘port’ number This information is written as a single char sequence by the ODR process to the domain socket that it creates for itself. It is read by msg_recv from the domain socket the client/server process creates, decomposed into the three components above, and returned to the caller of msg_recv.  Also see the section below entitled ODR and the API. Client  When a client is evoked at a node, it creates a domain datagram socket. The client should bind its socket to a ‘temporary’ (i.e., not ‘well-known’) sun_path name obtained from a call to tmpnam() (cf. line 10, Figure 15.6, p. 419) so that multiple clients may run at the same node.  Note that tmpnam() is actually highly deprecated. You should use the mkstemp() function instead - look up the online man pages on minix (‘man mkstemp’) for details.   As you run client code again and again during the development stage, the temporary files created by the calls to tmpnam / mkstemp start to proliferate since these files are not automatically removed when the client code terminates. You need to explicitly remove the file created by the client evocation by issuing a call to unlink() or to remove() in your client code just before the client code exits. See the online man pages on minix (‘man unlink’, ‘man remove’) for details. The client then enters an infinite loop repeating the steps below. The client prompts the user to choose one of vm1 , . . . . . , vm10 as a server node.  Client msg_sends a 1 or 2 byte message to server and prints out on stdout the message      client at node  vm i1  sending request to server at  vm i2 (In general, throughout this assignment, “trace” messages such as the one above should give the vm names and not IP addresses of the nodes.)  Client then blocks in msg_recv awaiting response. This attempt to read from the domain socket should be backed up by a timeout in case no response ever comes. I leave it up to you whether you ‘wrap’ the call to msg_recv in a timeout, or you implement the timeout inside msg_recv itself. When the client receives a response it prints out on stdout the message      client at node  vm i1 : received from   vm i2  <timestamp> If, on the other hand, the client times out, it should print out the message      client at node  vm i1 : timeout on response from   vm i2 The client then retransmits the message out, setting the flag parameter in msg_send to force a route rediscovery, and prints out an appropriate message on stdout. This is done only once, when a timeout for a given message to the server occurs for the first time.  Client repeats steps 1. - 3. Server  The server creates a domain datagram socket. The server socket is assumed to have a (node-local) ‘well-known’ sun_path name which it binds to. This ‘well-known’ sun_path name is designated by a (network-wide) ‘well-known’ ‘port’ value. The time client uses this ‘port’ value to communicate with the server.  The server enters an infinite sequence of calls to msg_recv followed by msg_send, awaiting client requests and responding to them. When it responds to a client request, it prints out on stdout the message                server at node  vm i1  responding to request from  vm i2 ODR  The ODR process runs on each of the ten vm machines. It is evoked with a single command line argument which gives a “staleness” time parameter, in seconds.  It uses get_hw_addrs (available to you on minix in ~cse533/Asgn3_code) to obtain the index, and associated (unicast) IP and Ethernet addresses for each of the node’s interfaces, except for the eth0 and lo (loopback) interfaces, which should be ignored. In the subdirectory ~cse533/Asgn3_code (/users/cse533/Asgn3_code) on minix I am providing you with two functions, get_hw_addrs and prhwaddrs. These are analogous to the get_ifi_info_plus and prifinfo_plus of Assignment 2. Like get_ifi_info_plus, get_hw_addrs uses ioctl. get_hw_addrs gets the (primary) IP address, alias IP addresses (if any), HW address, and interface name and index value for each of the node's interfaces (including the loopback interface lo). prhwaddrs prints that information out. You should modify and use these functions as needed.  Note that if an interface has no HW address associated with it (this is, typically, the case for the loopback interface lo for example), then ioctl returns get_hw_addrs a HW address which is the equivalent of 00:00:00:00:00:00 .  get_hw_addrs stores this in the appropriate field of its data structures as it would with any HW address returned by ioctl, but when prhwaddrs comes across such an address, it prints a blank line instead of its usual ‘HWaddr = xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx’. The ODR process creates one or more PF_PACKET sockets. You will need to try out PF_PACKET sockets for yourselves and familiarize yourselves with how they behave. If, when you read from the socket and provide a sockaddr_ll structure, the kernel returns to you the index of the interface on which the incoming frame was received, then one socket will be enough. Otherwise, somewhat in the manner of Assignment 2, you shall have to create a PF_PACKET socket for every interface of interest (which are all the interfaces of the node, excluding interfaces lo and eth0 ), and bind a socket to each interface. Furthermore, if the kernel also returns to you the source Ethernet address of the frame in the sockaddr_ll structure, then you can make do with SOCK_DGRAM type PF_PACKET sockets; otherwise you shall have to use SOCK_RAW type sockets (although I would prefer you to use SOCK_RAW type sockets anyway, even if it turns out you can make do with SOCK_DGRAM type).  The socket(s) should have a protocol value (no larger than 0xffff so that it fits in two bytes; this value is given as a network-byte-order parameter in the call(s) to function socket) that identifies your ODR protocol. The <linux/if_ether.h> include file (i.e., the file /usr/include/linux/if_ether.h) contains protocol values defined for the standard protocols typically found on an Ethernet LAN, as well as other values such as ETH_P_ALL. You should set protocol to a value of your choice which is not a <linux/if_ether.h> value, but which is, hopefully, unique to yourself. Remember that you will all be running your code using the same root account on the vm1 , . . . . . , vm10 nodes. So if two of you happen to choose the same protocol value and happen to be running on the same vm node at the same time, your applications will receive each other’s frames. For that reason, try to choose a protocol value for the socket(s) that is likely to be unique to yourself (something based on your Stony Brook student ID number, for example). This value effectively becomes the protocol value for your implementation of ODR, as opposed to some other cse 533 student's implementation. Because your value of protocol is to be carried in the frame type field of the Ethernet frame header, the value chosen should be not less than 1536 (0x600) so that it is not misinterpreted as the length of an Ethernet 802.3 frame.  Note from the man pages for packet(7) that frames are passed to and from the socket without any processing in the frame content by the device driver on the other side of the socket, except for calculating and tagging on the 4-byte CRC trailer for outgoing frames, and stripping that trailer before delivering incoming frames to the socket. Nevertheless, if you write a frame that is less than 60 bytes, the necessary padding is automatically added by the device driver so that the frame that is actually transmitted out is the minimum Ethernet size of 64 bytes. When reading from the socket, however, any such padding that was introduced into a short frame at the sending node to bring it up to the minimum frame size is not stripped off - it is included in what you receive from the socket (thus, the minimum number of bytes you receive should never be less than 60). Also, you will have to build the frame header for outgoing frames yourselves (assuming you use SOCK_RAW type sockets). Bear in mind that the field values in that header have to be in network order. The ODR process also creates a domain datagram socket for communication with application processes at the node, and binds the socket to a ‘well known’ sun_path name for the ODR service.  Because it is dealing with fixed topologies, ODR is, by and large, considerably simpler than AODV. In particular, discovered routes are relatively stable and there is no need for all the paraphernalia that goes with the possibility of routes changing (such as maintenance of active nodes in the routing tables and timeout mechanisms; timeouts on reverse links; lifetime field in the RREP messages; etc.)  Nor will we be implementing source_sequence_#s (in the RREQ messages), and dest_sequence_# (in RREQ and RREP messages). In reality, we should (though we will not, for the sake of simplicity, be doing so) implement some sort of sequence number mechanism, or some alternative mechanism such as split-horizon for example, if we are to avoid possible scenarios of routing loops in a “count to infinity” context (I shall explain this point in class).  However, we want ODR to discover shortest-hop paths, and we want it to do so in a reasonably efficient manner. This necessitates having one or two aspects of its operations work in a different, possibly slightly more complicated, way than AODV does. ODR has several basic responsibilities :  Build and maintain a routing table. For each destination in the table, the routing table structure should include, at a minimum, the next-hop node (in the form of the Ethernet address for that node) and outgoing interface index, the number of hops to the destination, and a timestamp of when the the routing table entry was made or last “reconfirmed” / updated. Note that a destination node in the table is to be identified only by its ‘canonical’ IP address, and not by any other IP addresses the node has.  Generate a RREQ in response to a time client calling msg_send for a destination for which ODR has no route (or for which a route exists, but msg_send has the flag parameter set or the route has gone ‘stale’ – see below), and ‘flood’ the RREQ out on all the node’s interfaces (except for the interface it came in on and, of course, the interfaces eth0 and lo). Flooding is done using an Ethernet broadcast destination address (0xff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) in the outgoing frame header.   Note that a copy of the broadcast packet is supposed to / might be looped back to the node that sends it (see p. 535 in the Stevens textbook). ODR will have to take care not to treat these copies as new incoming RREQs.   Also note that ODR at the client node increments the broadcast_id every time it issues a new RREQ for any destination node. When a RREQ is received, ODR has to generate a RREP if it is at the destination node, or if it is at an intermediate node that happens to have a route (which is not ‘stale’ – see below) to the destination. Otherwise, it must propagate the RREQ by flooding it out on all the node’s interfaces (except the interface the RREQ arrived on). Note that as it processes received RREQs, ODR should enter the ‘reverse’ route back to the source node into its routing table, or update an existing entry back to the source node if the RREQ received shows a shorter-hop route, or a route with the same number of hops but going through a different neighbour. The timestamp associated with the table entry should be updated whenever an existing route is either “reconfirmed” or updated. Obviously, if the node is going to generate a RREP, updating an existing entry back to the source node with a more efficient route, or a same-hops route using a different neighbour, should be done before the RREP is generated.  Unlike AODV, when an intermediate node receives a RREQ for which it generates a RREP, it should nevertheless continue to flood the RREQ it received if the RREQ pertains to a source node whose existence it has heretofore been unaware of, or the RREQ gives it a more efficient route than it knew of back to the source node (the reason for continuing to flood the RREQ is so that other nodes in the intranet also become aware of the existence of the source node or of the potentially more optimal reverse route to it, and update their tables accordingly). However, since an RREP for this RREQ is being sent by our node, we do not want other nodes who receive the RREQ propagated by our node, and who might be in a position to do so, to also send RREPs. So we need to introduce a field in the RREQ message, not present in the AODV specifications, which acts like a “RREP already sent” field. Our node sets this field before further propagating the RREQ and nodes receiving an RREQ with this field set do not send RREPs in response, even if they are in a position to do so.  ODR may, of course, receive multiple, distinct instances of the same RREQ (the combination of source_addr and broadcast_id uniquely identifies the RREQ). Such RREQs should not be flooded out unless they have a lower hop count than instances of that RREQ that had previously been received.  By the same token, if ODR is in a position to send out a RREP, and has already done so for this, now repeating, RREQ ,  it should not send out another RREP unless the RREQ shows a more efficient, previously unknown, reverse route back to the source node. In other words, ODR should not generate essentially duplicative RREPs, nor generate RREPs to instances of RREQs that reflect reverse routes to the source that are not more efficient than what we already have. Relay RREPs received back to the source node (this is done using the ‘reverse’ route entered into the routing table when the corresponding RREQ was processed). At the same time, a ‘forward’ path to the destination is entered into the routing table. ODR could receive multiple, distinct RREPs for the same RREQ. The ‘forward’ route entered in the routing table should be updated to reflect the shortest-hop route to the destination, and RREPs reflecting suboptimal routes should not be relayed back to the source. In general, maintaining a route and its associated timestamp in the table in response to RREPs received is done in the same manner described above for RREQs.  Forward time client/server messages along the next hop. (The following is important – you will lose points if you do not implement it.) Note that such application payload messages (especially if they are the initial request from the client to the server, rather than the server response back to the client) can be like “free” RREPs, enabling nodes along the path from source (client) to destination (server) node to build a reverse path back to the client node whose existence they were heretofore unaware of (or, possibly, to update an existing route with a more optimal one). Before it forwards an application payload message along the next hop, ODR at an intermediate node (and also at the final destination node) should use the message to update its routing table in this way. Thus, calls to msg_send by time servers should never cause ODR at the server node to initiate RREQs, since the receipt of a time client request implies that a route back to the client node should now exist in the routing table. The only exception to this is if the server node has a staleness parameter of zero (see below). A routing table entry has associated with it a timestamp that gives the time the entry was made into the table. When a client at a node calls msg_send, and if an entry for the destination node already exists in the routing table, ODR first checks that the routing information is not ‘stale’. A stale routing table entry is one that is older than the value defined by the staleness parameter given as a command line argument to the ODR process when it is executed. ODR deletes stale entries (as well as non-stale entries when the flag parameter in msg_send is set) and initiates a route rediscovery by issuing a RREQ for the destination node. This will force periodic updating of the routing tables to take care of failed nodes along the current path, Ethernet addresses that might have changed, and so on. Similarly, as RREQs propagate through the intranet, existing stale table entries at intermediate nodes are deleted and new route discoveries propagated. As noted above when discussing the processing of RREQs and RREPs, the associated timestamp for an existing table entry is updated in response to having the route either “reconfirmed” or updated (this applies to both reverse routes, by virtue of RREQs received, and to forward routes, by virtue of RREPs). Finally, note that a staleness parameter of 0 essentially indicates that the discovered route will be used only once, when first discovered, and then discarded. Effectively, an ODR with staleness parameter 0 maintains no real routing table at all ;  instead, it forces route discoveries at every step of its operation. As a practical matter, ODR should be run with staleness parameter values that are considerably larger than the longest RTT on the intranet, otherwise performance will degrade considerably (and collapse entirely as the parameter values approach 0). Nevertheless, for robustness, we need to implement a mechanism by which an intermediate node that receives a RREP or application payload message for forwarding and finds that its relevant routing table entry has since gone stale, can intiate a RREQ to rediscover the route it needs.  RREQ, RREP, and time client/server request/response messages will all have to be carried as encapsulated ODR protocol messages that form the data payload of Ethernet frames. So we need to design the structure of ODR protocol messages. The format should contain a type field (0 for RREQ, 1 for RREP, 2 for application payload ). The remaining fields in an ODR message will depend on what type it is. The fields needed for (our simplified versions of AODV’s) RREQ and RREP should be fairly clear to you, but keep in mind that you need to introduce two extra fields:  The “RREP already sent” bit or field in RREQ messages, as mentioned above.  A “forced discovery” bit or field in both RREQ and RREP messages:  When a client application forces route rediscovery, this bit should be set in the RREQ issued by the client node ODR.  Intermediate nodes that are not the destination node but which do have a route to the destination node should not respond with RREPs to an RREQ which has the forced discovery field set. Instead, they should continue to flood the RREQ so that it eventually reaches the destination node which will then respond with an RREP.  The intermediate nodes relaying such an RREQ must update their ‘reverse’ route back to the source node accordingly, even if the new route is less efficient (i.e., has more hops) than the one they currently have in their routing table.  The destination node responds to the RREQ with an RREP in which this field is also set.  Intermediate nodes that receive such a forced discovery RREP must update their ‘forward’ route to the destination node accordingly, even if the new route is less efficient (i.e., has more hops) than the one they currently have in their routing table.  This behaviour will cause a forced discovery RREQ to be responded to only by the destination node itself and not any other node, and will cause intermediate nodes to update their routing tables to both source and destination nodes in accordance with the latest routing information received, to cover the possibility that older routes are no longer valid because nodes and/or links along their paths have gone down. A type 2, application payload, message needs to contain the following type of information :  type  =  2 ‘canonical’ IP address of source node ‘port’ number of source application process (This, of course, is not a real port number in the TCP/UDP sense, but simply a value that ODR at the source node uses to designate the sun_path name for the source application’s domain socket.) ‘canonical’ IP address of destination node ‘port’ number of destination application process (This is passed to ODR by the application process at the source node when it calls msg_send. Its designates the sun_path name for an application’s domain socket at the destination node.) hop count (This starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 at each hop so that ODR can make use of the message to update its routing table, as discussed above.) number of bytes in application message The fields above essentially constitute a ‘header’ for the ODR message. Note that fields which you choose to have carry numeric values (rather than ascii characters, for example) must be in network byte order. ODR-defined numeric-valued fields in type 0, RREQ, and type 1, RREP, messages must, of course, also be in network byte order.  Also note that only the ‘canonical’ IP addresses are used for the source and destination nodes in the ODR header. The same has to be true in the headers for type 0, RREQ, and type 1, RREP, messages. The general rule is that ODR messages only carry ‘canonical’ IP node addresses.  The last field in the type 2 ODR message is essentially the data payload of the message.  application message given in the call to msg_send An ODR protocol message is encapsulated as the data payload of an Ethernet frame whose header it fills in as follows :  source address  =  Ethernet address of outgoing interface of the current node where ODR is processing the message. destination address  =  Ethernet broadcast address for type 0 messages; Ethernet address of next hop node for type 1 & 2 messages. protocol field  =  protocol value for the ODR PF_PACKET socket(s). Last but not least, whenever ODR writes an Ethernet frame out through its socket, it prints out on stdout the message      ODR at node  vm i1 : sending      frame  hdr    src  vm i1      dest  addr                                                       ODR msg      type n     src  vm i2      dest  vm i3 where addr is in presentation format (i.e., hexadecimal xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) and gives the destination Ethernet address in the outgoing frame header. Other nodes in the message should be identified by their vm name. A message should be printed out for each packet sent out on a distinct interface.  ODR and the API  When the ODR process first starts, it must construct a table in which it enters all well-known ‘port’ numbers and their corresponding sun_path names. These will constitute permanent entries in the table.  Thereafter, whenever it reads a message off its domain socket, it must obtain the sun_path name for the peer process socket and check whether that name is entered in the table. If not, it must select an ‘ephemeral’ ‘port’ value by which to designate the peer sun_path name and enter the pair  < port value , sun_path name >  into the table. Such entries cannot be permanent otherwise the table will grow unboundedly in time, with entries surviving for ever, beyond the peer processes’ demise. We must associate a time_to_live field with a non-permanent table entry, and purge the entry if nothing is heard from the peer for that amount of time. Every time a peer process for which a non-permanent table entry exists communicates with ODR, its time_to_live value should be reinitialized.  Note that when ODR writes to a peer, it is possible for the write to fail because the peer does not exist :  it could be a ‘well-known’ service that is not running, or we could be in the interval between a process with a non-permanent table entry terminating and the expiration of its time_to_live value. Notes  A proper implementation of ODR would probably require that RREQ and RREP messages be backed up by some kind of timeout and retransmission mechanism since the network transmission environment is not reliable. This would considerably complicate the implementation (because at any given moment, a node could have multiple RREQs that it has flooded out, but for which it has still not received RREPs; the situation is further complicated by the fact that not all intermediate nodes receiving and relaying RREQs necessarily lie on a path to the destination, and therefore should expect to receive RREPs), and, learning-wise, would not add much to the experience you should have gained from Assignment 2.",17,C,17,https://github.com/SOYJUN/Implement-ODR-protocol,2015-04-10 18:49:12+00:00,2024-07-05 03:10:31+00:00

Binance Chain’s primary focus, its native [decentralized application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) (“dApp”) [Binance DEX](https://www.binance.org/trade), has demonstrated its low-latency matching with large capacity headroom by handling millions of trading volume in a short time.  Flexibility and usability are often in an inverse relationship with performance. The concentration on providing a convenient digital asset issuing and trading venue also brings limitations. Binance Chain's most requested feature is the programmable extendibility, or simply the [Smart Contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) and Virtual Machine functions. Digital asset issuers and owners struggle to add new decentralized features for their assets or introduce any sort of community governance and activities.  Despite this high demand for adding the Smart Contract feature onto Binance Chain, it is a hard decision to make. The execution of a Smart Contract may slow down the exchange function and add non-deterministic factors to trading. If that compromise could be tolerated, it might be a straightforward idea to introduce a new Virtual Machine specification based on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/core/), based on the current underlying consensus protocol and major [RPC](https://docs.binance.org/api-reference/node-rpc.html) implementation of Binance Chain. But all these will increase the learning requirements for all existing dApp communities, and will not be very welcomed.  We propose a parallel blockchain of the current Binance Chain to retain the high performance of the native DEX blockchain and to support a friendly Smart Contract function at the same time.  # Design Principles  After the creation of the parallel blockchain into the Binance Chain ecosystem, two blockchains will run side by side to provide different services. The new parallel chain will be called “**Binance Smart Chain**” (short as “**BSC**” for the below sections), while the existing mainnet remains named “**Binance Chain**” (short as “**BC**” for the below sections).  Here are the design principles of **BSC**:  1. **Standalone Blockchain**: technically, BSC is a standalone blockchain, instead of a layer-2 solution. Most BSC fundamental  technical and business functions should be self-contained so that it can     run well even if the BC stopped for a short period. 2. **Ethereum  Compatibility**: The first practical and widely-used Smart Contract platform is Ethereum. To take advantage of the relatively mature applications and community, BSC chooses to be compatible with the existing Ethereum mainnet. This means most of the **dApps**, ecosystem components, and toolings will work with BSC and require zero or minimum changes; BSC node will require similar (or a bit higher) hardware specification and skills to run and operate. The implementation should leave room for BSC to catch up with further Ethereum upgrades. 3. **Staking Involved  Consensus and Governance**: Staking-based consensus is more environmentally friendly and leaves more flexible option to the community governance. Expectedly, this consensus should enable better network performance over [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) blockchain system, i.e., faster blocking time and higher transaction capacity. 4. **Native Cross-Chain Communication**: both BC and BSC will be implemented with native support for cross-chain communication among the two blockchains. The communication protocol should be bi-directional, decentralized, and trustless. It will concentrate on moving digital assets between BC and BSC, i.e., [BEP2](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP2.md) tokens, and eventually, other BEP tokens introduced later. The protocol should care for the minimum of other items stored in the state of the blockchains, with only a few exceptions.  # Consensus and Validator Quorum  Based on the above design principles, the consensus protocol of BSC is to fulfill the following goals:  1. Blocking time should be shorter than Ethereum network, e.g. 5 seconds or even shorter. 2. It requires limited time to confirm the finality of transactions, e.g. around 1-min level or shorter. 3. There is no inflation of native token: BNB, the block reward is collected from transaction fees, and it will be paid in BNB. 4. It is compatible with Ethereum system as much as possible. 5. It allows modern [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) blockchain network governance.  ## Proof of Staked Authority  Although Proof-of-Work (PoW) has been recognized as a practical mechanism to implement a decentralized network, it is not friendly to the environment and also requires a large size of participants to maintain the security.  Ethereum and some other blockchain networks, such as [MATIC Bor](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor), [TOMOChain](https://tomochain.com/), [GoChain](https://gochain.io/), [xDAI](https://xdai.io/), do use [Proof-of-Authority(PoA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_authority) or its variants in different scenarios, including both testnet and mainnet. PoA provides some defense to 51% attack, with improved efficiency and tolerance to certain levels of Byzantine players (malicious or hacked). It serves as an easy choice to pick as the fundamentals.  Meanwhile, the PoA protocol is most criticized for being not as decentralized as PoW, as the validators, i.e. the nodes that take turns to produce blocks, have all the authorities and are prone to corruption and security attacks. Other blockchains, such as EOS and Lisk both, introduce different types of [Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS) to allow the token holders to vote and elect the validator set. It increases the decentralization and favors community governance.  BSC here proposes to combine DPoS and PoA for consensus, so that: 1. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators 2. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner, similar to [Ethereum’s Clique](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-225) consensus design 3. Validator set are elected in and out based on a staking based governance  ## Validator Quorum  In the genesis stage, a few trusted nodes will run as the initial Validator Set. After the blocking starts, anyone can compete to join as candidates to elect as a validator. The staking status decides the top 21 most staked nodes to be the next validator set, and such an election will repeat every 24 hours.  **BNB** is the token used to stake for BSC.  In order to remain as compatible as Ethereum and upgradeable to future consensus protocols to be developed, BSC chooses to rely on the **BC** for staking management (Please refer to the below “[Staking and Governance](#staking-and-governance)” section). There is a **dedicated staking module for BSC on BC**. It will accept BSC staking from BNB holders and calculate the highest staked node set. Upon every UTC midnight, BC will issue a verifiable `ValidatorSetUpdate` cross-chain message to notify BSC to update its validator set.  While producing further blocks, the existing BSC validators check whether there is a `ValidatorSetUpdate` message relayed onto BSC periodically. If there is, they will update the validator set after an **epoch period**, i.e. a predefined number of blocking time. For example, if BSC produces a block every 5 seconds, and the epoch period is 240 blocks, then the current validator set will check and update the validator set for the next epoch in 1200 seconds (20 minutes).  ## Security and Finality  Given there are more than ½\*N+1 validators are honest, PoA based networks usually work securely and properly. However, there are still cases where certain amount Byzantine validators may still manage to attack the network, e.g. through the “[Clone Attack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10244.pdf)”. To secure as much as BC, BSC users are encouraged to wait until receiving blocks sealed by more than ⅔\*N+1 different validators. In that way, the BSC can be trusted at a similar security level to BC and can tolerate less than ⅓\*N Byzantine validators.  With 21 validators, if the block time is 5 seconds, the ⅔\*N+1 different validator seals will need a time period of (⅔\*21+1)*5 = 75 seconds. Any critical applications for BSC may have to wait for ⅔\*N+1 to ensure a relatively secure finality. However, besides such arrangement, BSC does introduce **Slashing** logic to penalize Byzantine validators for **double signing** or **inavailability**, which will be covered in the “Staking and Governance” section later. This Slashing logic will expose the malicious validators in a very short time and make the “Clone Attack” very hard or extremely non-beneficial to execute. With this enhancement, ½\*N+1 or even fewer blocks are enough as confirmation for most transactions.  ## Reward  All the BSC validators in the current validator set will be rewarded with transaction **fees in BNB**. As BNB is not an inflationary token, there will be no mining rewards as what Bitcoin and Ethereum network generate, and the gas fee is the major reward for validators. As BNB is also utility tokens with other use cases, delegators and validators will still enjoy other benefits of holding BNB.  The reward for validators is the fees collected from transactions in each block. Validators can decide how much to give back to the delegators who stake their BNB to them, in order to attract more staking. Every validator will take turns to produce the blocks in the same probability (if they stick to 100% liveness), thus, in the long run, all the stable validators may get a similar size of the reward. Meanwhile, the stakes on each validator may be different, so this brings a counter-intuitive situation that more users trust and delegate to one validator, they potentially get less reward. So rational delegators will tend to delegate to the one with fewer stakes as long as the validator is still trustful (insecure validator may bring slashable risk). In the end, the stakes on all the validators will have less variation. This will actually prevent the stake concentration and “winner wins forever” problem seen on some other networks.  Some parts of the gas fee will also be rewarded to relayers for Cross-Chain communication. Please refer to the “[Relayers](#relayers)” section below.  # Token Economy  BC and BSC share the same token universe for BNB and BEP2 tokens. This defines:  1. The same token can circulate on both networks, and flow between them bi-directionally     via a cross-chain communication mechanism. 2. The total circulation of the same token should be managed across the two networks, i.e. the total effective supply of a token should be the sum of the     token’s total effective supply on both BSC and BC. 3. The tokens can be initially created on BSC in a similar format as ERC20 token standard, or on BC as a BEP2, then created on the other. There are native ways on both networks to link the two and secure the total supply of the token.  ## Native Token  BNB will run on BSC in the same way as ETH runs on Ethereum so that it remains as “native token” for both BSC and BC. This means, in addition to BNB is used to pay most of the fees on Binance Chain and Binance DEX, BNB will be also used to:  1. pay “fees“ to deploy smart contracts on BSC 2. stake on selected BSC validators, and get corresponding rewards 3. perform cross-chain operations, such as transfer token assets across BC and BSC  ### Seed Fund  Certain amounts of BNB will be burnt on BC and minted on BSC during its genesis stage. This amount is called “Seed Fund” to circulate on BSC after the first block, which will be dispatched to the initial BC-to-BSC Relayer(described in later sections) and initial validator set introduced at genesis. These BNBs are used to pay transaction fees in the early stage to transfer more BNB from BC onto BSC via the cross-chain mechanism.  The BNB cross-chain transfer is discussed in a later section, but for BC to BSC transfer, it is generally to lock BNB on BC from the source address of the transfer to a system-controlled address and unlock the corresponding amount from special contract to the target address of the transfer on BSC, or reversely, when transferring from BSC to BC, it is to lock BNB from the source address on BSC into a special contract and release locked amount on BC from the system address to the target address. The logic is related to native code on BC and a series of smart contracts on BSC.  ## Other Tokens  BC supports BEP2 tokens and upcoming [BEP8 tokens](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/pull/69), which are native assets transferrable and tradable (if listed) via fast transactions and sub-second finality. Meanwhile, as BSC is Ethereum compatible, it is natural to support ERC20 tokens on BSC, which here is called “**BEP2E**” (with the real name to be introduced by the future BEPs,it potentially covers BEP8 as well). BEP2E may be “Enhanced” by adding a few more methods to expose more information, such as token denomination, decimal precision definition and the owner address who can decide the Token Binding across the chains. BSC and BC work together to ensure that one token can circulate in both formats with confirmed total supply and be used in different use cases.  ### Token Binding  BEP2 tokens will be extended to host a new attribute to associate the token with a BSC BEP2E  token contract, called “**Binder**”, and this process of association is called “**Token Binding**”.  Token Binding can happen at any time after BEP2 and BEP2E are ready. The token owners of either BEP2 or BEP2E don’t need to bother about the Binding, until before they really want to use the tokens on different scenarios. Issuers can either create BEP2 first or BEP2E first, and they can be bound at a later time. Of course, it is encouraged for all the issuers of BEP2 and BEP2E to set the Binding up early after the issuance.  A typical procedure to bind the BEP2 and BEP2E will be like the below:  1. Ensure both the BEP2 token and the BEP2E token both exist on each blockchain, with the same total supply. BEP2E should have 3 more methods than typical ERC20 token standard:     *  symbol(): get token symbol     *  decimals(): get the number of the token decimal digits     *  owner(): get **BEP2E contract owner’s address.** This value should be initialized in the BEP2E contract constructor so that the further binding action can verify whether the action is from the BEP2E owner.  2. Decide the initial circulation on both blockchains. Suppose the total supply is *S*, and the expected initial circulating supply on BC is *K*, then the owner should lock S-K tokens to a system controlled address on BC.  3. Equivalently, *K* tokens is locked in the special contract on BSC, which handles major binding functions and is named as **TokenHub**. The issuer of the BEP2E token should lock the *K* amount of that token into TokenHub, resulting in *S-K* tokens to circulate on BSC. Thus the total circulation across 2 blockchains remains as *S*.  4. The issuer of BEP2 token sends the bind transaction on BC. Once the transaction is executed successfully after proper verification:     * It transfers *S-K* tokens to a system-controlled address on BC.     * A cross-chain bind request package will be created, waiting for Relayers to relay.  5. BSC Relayers will relay the cross-chain bind request package into **TokenHub** on BSC, and the corresponding request and information will be stored into the contract.  6. The contract owner and only the owner can run a special method of TokenHub contract, `ApproveBind`, to verify the binding request to mark it as a success. It will confirm:     * the token has not been bound;     * the binding is for the proper symbol, with proper total supply and decimal information;     * the proper lock are done on both networks;  10. Once the `ApproveBind` method has succeeded, TokenHub will mark the two tokens are bounded and share the same circulation on BSC, and the status will be propagated back to BC. After this final confirmation, the BEP2E contract address and decimals will be written onto the BEP2 token as a new attribute on BC, and the tokens can be transferred across the two blockchains bidirectionally. If the ApproveBind fails, the  failure event will also be propagated back to BC to release the locked tokens, and the above steps can be re-tried later.  # Cross-Chain Transfer and Communication Cross-chain communication is the key foundation to allow the community to take advantage of the dual chain structure:  * users are free to create any tokenization, financial products, and digital assets on BSC or BC as they wish * the items on BSC can be manually and programmingly traded and circulated in a stable, high throughput, lighting fast and friendly environment of BC * users can operate these in one UI and tooling ecosystem.  ## Cross-Chain Transfer  The cross-chain transfer is the key communication between the two blockchains. Essentially the logic is:  1. the `transfer-out` blockchain will lock the amount from source owner addresses into a system controlled address/contracts; 2. the `transfer-in` blockchain will unlock the amount from the system controlled address/contracts and send it to target addresses.  The cross-chain transfer package message should allow the BSC Relayers and BC **Oracle Relayers** to verify:  1. Enough amount of token assets are removed from the source address and locked into a system controlled addresses/contracts on the source blockchain. And this can be confirmed on the target blockchain. 2. Proper amounts of token assets are released from a system controlled addresses/contracts and allocated into target addresses on the target blockchain. If this fails, it can be confirmed on source blockchain, so that the locked token can be released back (may deduct fees). 3. The sum of the total circulation of the token assets across the 2 blockchains are not changed after this transfer action completes, no matter if the transfer succeeds or not.  ![cross-chain](./assets/cross-chain.png)  The architecture of cross-chain communication is as in the above diagram. To accommodate the 2 heteroid systems, communication handling is different in each direction.  ## BC to BSC Architecture  BC is a Tendermint-based, instant finality blockchain. Validators with at least ⅔\*N+1 of the total voting power will co-sign each block on the chain. So that it is practical to verify the block transactions and even the state value via **Block Header** and **Merkle Proof** verification. This has been researched and implemented as “**Light-Client Protocol**”, which are intensively discussed in [the Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Light-client-protocol) community, studied and implemented for [Cosmos inter-chain communication](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/blob/a4173c91560567bdb7cc9abee8e61256fc3725e9/spec/ics-007-tendermint-client/README.md).  BC-to-BSC communication will be verified in an “**on-chain light client**” implemented via BSC **Smart Contracts** (some of them may be **“pre-compiled”**). After some transactions and state change happen on BC, if a transaction is defined to trigger cross-chain communication,the Cross-chain “**package**” message will be created and **BSC Relayers** will pass and submit them onto BSC as data into the ""build-in system contracts"". The build-in system contracts will verify the package and execute the transactions if it passes the verification. The verification will be guaranteed with the below design:  1. BC blocking status will be synced to the light client contracts on BSC from time to time, via     block header and pre-commits, for the below information:     * block and app hash of BC that are signed by validators     * current validatorset, and validator set update  2. the key-value from the blockchain state will be verified based on the Merkle     Proof and information from above #1.  After confirming the key-value is accurate and trustful, the build-in system contracts will execute the actions corresponding to the cross-chain packages. Some examples of such packages that can be created for BC-to-BSC are:  1. Bind: bind the BEP2 tokens and BEP2E 2. Transfer: transfer tokens after binding, this means the circulation will decrease (be locked)     from BC and appear in the target address balance on BSC 3. Error Handling: to handle any timeout/failure event for BSC-to-BC communication 4. Validatorset update of BSC  To ensure no duplication, proper message sequence and timely timeout, there is a “Channel” concept introduced on BC to manage any types of the communication.  For relayers, please also refer to the below “Relayers” section.  ## BSC to BC Architecture  BSC uses Proof of Staked Authority consensus protocol, which has a chance to fork and requires confirmation of more blocks. One block only has the signature of one validator, so that it is not easy to rely on one block to verify data from BSC.  To take full advantage of validator quorum of BC, an idea similar to many [Bridge ](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-bridge)or Oracle blockchains is adopted:  1. The cross-chain communication requests from BSC will be submitted and executed onto BSC as transactions. The execution of the transanction wil emit `Events`, and such events can be observed and packaged in certain “**Oracle**” onto BC. Instead of Block Headers, Hash and Merkle Proof, this type of “Oracle” package directly contains the cross-chain information for actions, such as sender, receiver and amount for transfer. 2. To ensure the security of the Oracle, the validators of BC will form anothe quorum of “**Oracle Relayers**”. Each validator of the BC should run a **dedicated process** as the Oracle Relayer. These Oracle Relayers will submit and  vote for the cross-chain communication package, like Oracle, onto BC,  using the same validator keys. Any package signed by more than ⅔\*N+1 Oracle Relayers’ voting power is as secure as any block signed by ⅔\*N+1 of     the same quorum of validators’ voting power.  By using the same validator quorum, it saves the light client code on BC and continuous block updates onto BC. Such Oracles also have Oracle IDs and types, to ensure sequencing and proper error handling.  ## Timeout and Error Handling  There are scenarios that the cross-chain communication fails. For example, the relayed package cannot be executed on BSC due to some coding bug in the contracts. **Timeout and error handling logics are** used in such scenarios.  For the recognizable user and system errors or any expected exceptions, the two networks should heal themselves. For example, when BC to BSC transfer fails, BSC will issue a failure event and Oracle Relayers will execute a refund on BC; when BSC to BC transfer fails, BC will issue a refund package for Relayer to relay in order to unlock the fund.  However, unexpected error or exception may still happen on any step of the cross-chain communication. In such a case, the Relayers and Oracle Relayers will discover that the corresponding cross-chain channel is stuck in a particular sequence. After a Timeout period, the Relayers and Oracle Relayers can request a “SkipSequence” transaction, the stuck sequence will be marked as “Unexecutable”. A corresponding alerts will be raised, and the community has to discuss how to handle this scenario, e.g. payback via the sponsor of the validators, or event clear the fund during next network upgrade.  ## Cross-Chain User Experience  Ideally, users expect to use two parallel chains in the same way as they use one single chain. It requires more aggregated transaction types to be added onto the cross-chain communication to enable this, which will add great complexity, tight coupling, and maintenance burden. Here BC and BSC only implement the basic operations to enable the value flow in the initial launch and leave most of the user experience work to client side UI, such as wallets. E.g. a great wallet may allow users to sell a token directly from BSC onto BC’s DEX order book, in a secure way.  ## Cross-Chain Contract Event  Cross-Chain Contract Event (CCCE) is designed to allow a smart contract to trigger cross-chain transactions, directly through the contract code. This becomes possible based on:  1. Standard  system contracts can be provided to serve operations callable by general     smart contracts; 2. Standard  events can be emitted by the standard contracts; 3. Oracle Relayers can capture the standard events, and trigger the corresponding cross-chain operations; 4. Dedicated, code-managed address (account) can be created on BC and accessed by the     contracts on the BSC, here it is named as **“Contract Address on BC” (CAoB)**.  Several standard operations are implemented:  1. BSC to BC transfer: this is implemented in the same way as normal BSC to BC transfer, by only triggered via standard contract. The fund can be transferred to any addresses on BC, including the corresponding CAoB of  the transfer originating contract. 2. Transfer on BC: this is implemented as a special cross-chain transfer, while the  real transfer is from **CAoB** to any other address (even another CAoB). 3. BC to BSC transfer: this is implemented as two-pass cross-chain communication. The     first is triggered by the BSC contract and propagated onto BC, and then in the second pass, BC will start a normal BC to BSC cross-chain transfer, from **CAoB** to contract address on BSC. A special note should be paid on that the BSC contract only increases balance upon any transfer coming in on the second pass, and the error handling in the second pass is the same as the normal BC to BSC transfer. 4. IOC  (Immediate-Or-Cancel) Trade Out: the primary goal of transferring assets to BC is to trade. This event will instruct to trade a certain amount of an asset in CAoB into another asset as much as possible and transfer out     all the results, i.e. the left the source and the traded target tokens of     the trade, back to BSC. BC will handle such relayed events by sending an     “Immediate-Or-Cancel”, i.e. IOC order onto the trading pairs, once the next matching finishes, the result will be relayed back to BSC, which can be in either one or two assets. 5. Auction Trade Out: Such event will instruct BC to send an auction order to trade a     certain amount of an asset in **CAoB** into another asset as much as possible and transfer out all the results back to BSC at the end of the auction. Auction function is upcoming on BC.  There are some details for the Trade Out:  1. both can have a limit price (absolute or relative) for the trade; 2. the end result will be written as cross-chain packages to relay back to BSC; 3. cross-chain communication fees may be charged from the asset transferred back to BSC; 4. BSC contract maintains a mirror of the balance and outstanding orders on CAoB. No     matter what error happens during the Trade Out, the final status will be  propagated back to the originating contract and clear its internal state.  With the above features, it simply adds the cross-chain transfer and exchange functions with high liquidity onto all the smart contracts on BSC. It will greatly add the application scenarios on Smart Contract and dApps, and make 1 chain +1 chain > 2 chains.  # Staking and Governance  Proof of Staked Authority brings in decentralization and community involvement. Its core logic can be summarized as the below. You may see similar ideas from other networks, especially Cosmos and EOS.  1. Token holders, including the validators, can put their tokens “**bonded**” into the stake. Token holders can **delegate** their tokens onto any validator or validator candidate, to expect it can become an actual validator, and later they can choose a different validator or candidate to **re-delegate** their tokens<sup>1</sup>. 2. All validator candidates will be ranked by the number of bonded tokens on them, and the top ones will become the real validators. 3. Validators can share (part of) their blocking reward with their delegators. 4. Validators can suffer from “**Slashing**”, a punishment for their bad behaviors, such as double sign and/or instability. 5. There is an “**unbonding period**” for validators and delegators so that the system makes sure the tokens remain bonded when bad behaviors are caught, the responsible will get slashed during this period.  ## Staking on BC  Ideally, such staking and reward logic should be built into the blockchain, and automatically executed as the blocking happens. Cosmos Hub, who shares the same Tendermint consensus and libraries with Binance Chain, works in this way.  BC has been preparing to enable staking logic since the design days. On the other side, as BSC wants to remain compatible with Ethereum as much as possible, it is a great challenge and efforts to implement such logic on it. This is especially true when Ethereum itself may move into a different Proof of Stake consensus protocol in a short (or longer) time. In order to keep the compatibility and reuse the good foundation of BC, the staking logic of BSC is implemented on BC:  1. The staking token is BNB, as it is a native token on both blockchains anyway 2. The staking, i.e. token bond and delegation actions and records for BSC, happens on BC. 3. The BSC validator set is determined by its staking and delegation logic, via a  staking module built on BC for BSC, and propagated every day UTC 00:00 from BC to BSC via Cross-Chain communication. 4. The reward distribution happens on BC around every day UTC 00:00.  ## Rewarding  Both the validator update and reward distribution happen every day around UTC 00:00. This is to save the cost of frequent staking updates and block reward distribution. This cost can be significant, as the blocking reward is collected on BSC and distributed on BC to BSC validators and delegators. (Please note BC blocking fees will remain rewarding to BC validators only.)   A deliberate delay is introduced here to make sure the distribution is fair:  1. The blocking reward will not be sent to validator right away, instead, they will be distributed and accumulated on a contract; 2. Upon receiving the validator set update into BSC, it will trigger a few cross-chain transfers to transfer the reward to custody addresses on the corresponding validators. The custody addresses are owned by the system so that the reward cannot be spent until the promised distribution to delegators happens. 3. In order to make the synchronization simpler and allocate time to accommodate slashing, the reward for N day will be only distributed in N+2 days. After the delegators get the reward, the left will be transferred to validators’ own reward addresses.  ## Slashing  Slashing is part of the on-chain governance, to ensure the malicious or negative behaviors are punished. BSC slash can be submitted by anyone. The transaction submission requires **slash evidence** and cost fees but also brings a larger reward when it is successful.  So far there are two slashable cases.  ### Double Sign  It is quite a serious error and very likely deliberate offense when a validator signs more than one block with the same height and parent block. The reference protocol implementation should already have logic to prevent this, so only the malicious code can trigger this. When Double Sign happens, the validator should be removed from the Validator **Set** right away.  Anyone can submit a slash request on BC with the evidence of Double Sign of BSC, which should contain the 2 block headers with the same height and parent block, sealed by the offending validator. Upon receiving the evidence, if the BC verifies it to be valid:  1. The validator will be removed from validator set by an instance BSC validator set update Cross-Chain update; 2. A predefined amount of BNB would be slashed from the **self-delegated** BNB of the validator; Both validator and its delegators will not receive the staking rewards.  3. Part of the slashed BNB will allocate to the submitter’s address, which is a reward and larger than the cost of submitting slash request transaction 4. The rest of the slashed BNB will allocate to the other validators’ custody addresses, and distributed to all delegators in the same way as blocking reward.  ### Inavailability  The liveness of BSC relies on everyone in the Proof of Staked Authority validator set can produce blocks timely when it is their turn. Validators can miss their turn due to any reason, especially problems in their hardware, software, configuration or network. This instability of the operation will hurt the performance and introduce more indeterministic into the system.  There can be an internal smart contract responsible for recording the missed blocking metrics of each validator. Once the metrics are above the predefined threshold, the blocking reward for validator will not be relayed to BC for distribution but shared with other better validators. In such a way, the poorly-operating validator should be gradually voted out of the validator set as their delegators will receive less or none reward. If the metrics remain above another higher level of threshold, the validator will be dropped from the rotation, and this will be propagated back to BC, then a predefined amount of BNB would be slashed from the **self-delegated** BNB of the validator. Both validators and delegators will not receive their staking rewards.   ###  Governance Parameters  There are many system parameters to control the behavior of the BSC, e.g. slash amount, cross-chain transfer fees. All these parameters will be determined by BSC Validator Set together through a proposal-vote process based on their staking. Such the process will be carried on BC, and the new parameter values will be picked up by corresponding system contracts via a cross-chain communication.  # Relayers  Relayers are responsible to submit Cross-Chain Communication Packages between the two blockchains. Due to the heterogeneous parallel chain structure, two different types of Relayers are created.  ## BSC Relayers  Relayers for BC to BSC communication referred to as “**BSC Relayers**”, or just simply “Relayers”. Relayer is a standalone process that can be run by anyone, and anywhere, except that Relayers must register themselves onto BSC and deposit a certain refundable amount of BNB. Only relaying requests from the registered Relayers will be accepted by BSC.   The package they relay will be verified by the on-chain light client on BSC. The successful relay needs to pass enough verification and costs gas fees on BSC, and thus there should be incentive reward to encourage the community to run Relayers.  ### Incentives  There are two major communication types:  1. Users triggered Operations, such as `token bind` or `cross chain transfer`. Users must pay additional fee to as relayer reward. The reward will be shared with the relayers who sync the referenced blockchain headers. Besides, the reward won't be paid the relayers' accounts directly. A reward distribution mechanism will be brought in to avoid monopolization. 2. System Synchronization, such as delivering `refund package`(caused by failures of most oracle relayers), special blockchain header synchronization(header contains BC validatorset update), BSC staking package. System reward contract will pay reward to relayers' accounts directly.  If some Relayers have faster networks and better hardware, they can monopolize all the package relaying and leave no reward to others. Thus fewer participants will join for relaying, which encourages centralization and harms the efficiency and security of the network. Ideally, due to the decentralization and dynamic re-election of BSC validators, one Relayer can hardly be always the first to relay every message. But in order to avoid the monopolization further, the rewarding economy is also specially designed to minimize such chance:  1. The reward for Relayers will be only distributed in batches, and one batch will cover a number of successful relayed packages. 2. The reward a Relayer can get from a batch distribution is not linearly in proportion to their number of successful relayed packages. Instead, except the first a few relays, the more a Relayer relays during a batch period, the less reward it will collect.  ## Oracle Relayers  Relayers for BSC to BC communication are using the “Oracle” model, and so-called “**Oracle Relayers**”. Each of the validators must, and only the ones of the validator set, run Oracle Relayers. Each Oracle Relayer watches the blockchain state change. Once it catches Cross-Chain Communication Packages, it will submit to vote for the requests. After Oracle Relayers from ⅔ of the voting power of BC validators vote for the changes, the cross-chain actions will be performed.  Oracle Replayers should wait for enough blocks to confirm the finality on BSC before submitting and voting for the cross-chain communication packages onto BC.  The cross-chain fees will be distributed to BC validators together with the normal BC blocking rewards.  Such oracle type relaying depends on all the validators to support. As all the votes for the cross-chain communication packages are recorded on the blockchain, it is not hard to have a metric system to assess the performance of the Oracle Relayers. The poorest performer may have their rewards clawed back via another Slashing logic introduced in the future.  # Outlook  It is hard to conclude for Binance Chain, as it has never stopped evolving. The dual-chain strategy is to open the gate for users to take advantage of the fast transferring and trading on one side, and flexible and extendable programming on the other side, but it will be one stop along the development of Binance Chain. Here below are the topics to look into so as to facilitate the community better for more usability and extensibility:  1. Add different digital asset model for different business use cases 2. Enable more data feed, especially DEX market data, to be communicated from Binance DEX to BSC 3.

BlockchainLabs/Krypton,"Ethereum has brought us tools like Smart Contract, Dapp and DAO creation, deployment, and management. We can easily pay someone without ever hitting the send button, access decentralized applications that cannot be censored or shut down and we can be part of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.  Mistakes were made, bugs were found, and recently, millions were lost. Some are calling The DAO hack the most expensive bug bounty ever held, but whoever said this certainly didn’t have his Ether invested in The DAO, as the situation regarding the seizure of the stolen funds doesn’t seem to be improving.  The DAO happened, it failed, all we can do now is move on and learn from our mistakes. The problem is that if we keep learning from $50m errors, we’ll be the wisest and poorest people on the planet.  That’s why it’s good to have training wheels sometimes. Ethereum is the perfect playground for skilled developers, but with its 700% value increase since creation, it has made Solidity, one of the programming languages in Ethereum, a very expensive toy.  That’s why Krypton has launched an open invitation to all developers to poke around the Krypton blockchain and see what it has to offer.  Krypton (KR) is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that allows users all the same features and perks (Smart Contracts, Dapps, DAOs, DACs) but for a lower “price.” Ethereum transaction fees, which are known as “Gas” are spent according to computational costs, which means that the higher the price of Ether, the higher those costs will be.  covertress, the Krypton founder, and project manager said:  We’ve contacted several faculties at major universities and invited them to use the KR chain for this purpose. All of this means that developers have a testbed for smart contracts and Dapps, which are less expensive to deploy in the KR blockchain, before moving on to a more mainstream environment like Ethereum. Krypton can now be considered as a “gateway” into Ethereum.  The team isn’t planning to stay humble forever but will, however, take their time before deploying anything and becoming a direct competitor to Ethereum, allowing them to tighten up security and functionality before moving on to providing smart contracts and Dapp solutions for companies.

Krypton – Smart Contracts and DAPPs Development for Business Systems & IoT  Ticker: KR  Algorithm: Dagger-Hashimoto  Block Reward: 0.25 KR  Block Target: 15 Seconds  Listen Port: 17171  RPC Port: 8888  Total KR: ~2.669 Million  Real-Time Total KR  Ethereum-Based: Utilizes Smart Contracts, DAOs, DACs and DAPPs  Block Explorer: http://explorer.krypton.rocks  After years in the tech sector, for engineering, entertainment, travel & finance companies, I’ve turned my focus to blockchain and building a startup, Krypton, to help companies realize their distributed applications.  $KR is my vision for an ultra-fast blockchain that can realize all of the features of Ethereum with fewer initial coins, faster speed and lower inflation.  Krypton can do the same things as Ethereum. However, with Ethereum’s codebase being updated to safely deploy DAOs, DACs, and DAPPs, there will be an explosion of practical-use cases, especially in the Internet of Things field. Companies will be actively seeking experienced developers.  KR is an alternative platform on which to deploy these new technologies and Krypton developers are ready to build these systems.  Join me in connecting Ðapps devs with real-life applications. Let’s code the future.  — covertress, Founder & Project Manager  Krypton is now hiring Smart Contracts and Ðapps developers with experience in Solidity, JS, and node.js.

nima0011/nima0011,"# Contributing to this repository <!-- omit in toc -->  ## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->  Before you begin: - This site is powered by Node.js. Check to see if you're on the [version of node we support](contributing/development.md). - Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)? - Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) & see if we [accept contributions](#types-of-contributions-memo) for your type of issue.  ### Use the 'make a contribution' button  ![](./assets/images/make-contribution.gif)  Navigating a new codebase can be challenging, so we're making that a little easier. As you're using docs.github.com, you may come across an article that you want to make an update to. You can click on the **make a contribution** button right on that article, which will take you to the file in this repo where you'll make your changes.  Before you make your changes, check to see if an [issue exists](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/) already for the change you want to make.  ### Don't see your issue? Open one  If you spot something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.  ### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo  Fork using GitHub Desktop:  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop. - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

If you find a typo in the site policy section, you can open a pull request to fix it. For anything else, see [the CONTRIBUTING guide in the site-policy repo](https://github.com/github/site-policy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).  ## Starting with an issue You can browse existing issues to find something that needs help!  ### Labels Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with. - The [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on. - The [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners. - The [`content` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acontent) is for problems or updates in the content on docs.github.com. These will usually require some knowledge of Markdown. - The [`engineering` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aengineering) is for problems or updates in the docs.github.com website. These will usually require some knowledge of JavaScript/Node.js or YAML to fix.  ## Opening a pull request You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.  ## Working in the github/docs repository Here's some information that might be helpful while working on a Docs PR:  - [Development](/contributing/development.md) - This short guide describes how to get this app running on your local machine.  - [Content markup reference](/contributing/content-markup-reference.md) - All of our content is written in GitHub-flavored Markdown, with some additional enhancements.  - [Content style guide for GitHub Docs](/contributing/content-style-guide.md) - This guide covers GitHub-specific information about how we style our content and images. It also links to the resources we use for general style guidelines.  - [Reusables](/data/reusables/README.md) - We use reusables to help us keep content up to date. Instead of writing the same long string of information in several articles, we create a reusable, then call it from the individual articles.  - [Variables](/data/variables/README.md) - We use variables the same way we use reusables. Variables are for short strings of reusable text.  - [Liquid](/contributing/liquid-helpers.md) - We use liquid helpers to create different versions of our content.  - [Scripts](/script/README.md) - The scripts directory is the home for all of the scripts you can run locally.  - [Tests](/tests/README.md) - We use tests to ensure content will render correctly on the site. Tests run automatically in your PR, and sometimes it's also helpful to run them locally.  ## Reviewing We (usually the docs team, but sometimes GitHub product managers, engineers, or supportocats too!) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use GitHub.  :yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.   :yellow_heart: Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.   :yellow_heart: Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.    ### Self review You should always review your own PR first.  For content changes, make sure that you: - [ ] Confirm that the changes address every part of the content design plan from your issue (if there are differences, explain them). - [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy. - [ ] Review the entire pull request using the [localization checklist](contributing/localization-checklist.md). - [ ] Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the style guide. - [ ] Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is correct. - [ ] Check that all of your changes render correctly in staging. Remember, that lists and tables can be tricky. - [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.  ### Pull request template When you open a pull request, you must fill out the ""Ready for review"" template before we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.  ### Suggested changes We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.  As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).  ## Windows  This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:  1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix based systems use `\n`. Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker. 1. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either. 1. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.",15,,7,https://github.com/nima0011/nima0011,2020-12-30 10:25:00+00:00,2024-09-07 15:08:42+00:00

NanaYngvarrdottir/Software-Testing,"Virtual Reality is an experimental and innovative framework containing advanced tools and options for creating virtual world applications. Virtual Reality is not a virtual world, nor a stand-alone application, it is a scalable and customizable platform containing some basic modules and based on some fundamental innovative pillars (peer-to-peer architecture, secure communication infrastructure, leg al framework, powerful scripting language); additional modules can be built on top of it on demand.  The core of Virtual Reality is the innovative Virtual Reality Engine based on a hybrid peer-to-peer infrastructure that allows the sharing of computational load in experiencing the virtual environment obtaining infrastructural resource optimization and bandwidth reduction. It enhances the platform in terms of robustness, availability, scalability, load balancing.  From an higher level point of view, Virtual Reality is provided with a Legal Framework that allows to conclude deals and to carry out transaction directly in-world. To obtain this aim, Virtual Reality is integrated with a secure communication infrastructure based on a strong identity system that bounds the avatar to the real identity of the person behind, that is responsible of his actions as in real life. In case of infringement of the contract terms, an in-world dispute resolution is implemented within the platform The design of such system carefully mimics the Model Agreement provided by The International Mediation Institute, www.IMImediation.org .  The main Science & Technology objectives of the project were:  to create a scalable, reliable p2p architecture for a 3d environment: two innovative custom libraries have been developed, namely vrnet and vrengine that allow the creation of a coherent world on top of a overlay network leveraging on a newly introduced authority mechanism; to create a secure and trusted infrastructure and a certified authentication system: it allows end-to-end security in communications between either users or participating virtual nodes; this layer is built upon PKI and stresses the role of mutually entrusted communication streams as well as digital signature of documents and proof of identity; to implement a virtual law system: leveraging the platform built-in strong identity, users are allowed to carry out transactions directly in-world (contracts and online dispute resolution system) and to participate to its ruling via customizable Constitution and Law System; to create a powerful scripting engine, allowing the users to interact with the virtual world. Scripting has been targeted toward programmers, privileging power over ease-of-use;  This innovative approach has received some encouraging feedbacks from private universities and training companies, so that a specific applicative scenario has been customized for educational purposes (Virtual Campus). The Virtual Campus scenario takes also advantage from the interactivity enabled by the Virtual Reality scripting engine. From the legal side, some Contracts template specifically targeted to the relationships existing among private universities, teachers and students, cover the main use cases.  Moreover, after a careful examination of potential business applications, thanks to the powerful scripting engine has been possible to obtain a specific applicative scenario (industrial scenario) aimed, for example, to provide a testing platform for streetcars/railway designers/manufacturers. The project has devoted great attention also on dissemination and exploitation activities; more than thirty publications have been written and more than one hundred fifty potential stakeholders have been contacted in order to build a business relationship.  Platform Validation has demonstrated that Virtual Reality offers the architectural support for adoption of the platform, whether in autonomous or assisted usage, in educational and industrial application domains (i.e. Virtual Campus and Street-cars).  The validation highlighted some improvements area, in particular with respect to the usability and 3D interaction mode. Notwithstanding this finding, the users in both the domains were able to perform the planned scenarios and the validation exercises.

NAalytics/Assemblies-of-putative-SARS-CoV2-spike-encoding-mRNA-sequences-for-vaccines-BNT-162b2-and-mRNA-1273,"RNA vaccines have become a key tool in moving forward through the challenges raised both in the current pandemic and in numerous other public health and medical challenges.  With the rollout of vaccines for COVID-19, these synthetic mRNAs have become broadly distributed RNA species in numerous human populations.  Despite their ubiquity, sequences are not always available for such RNAs.  Standard methods facilitate such sequencing.  In this note, we provide experimental sequence information for the RNA components of the initial Moderna (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32756549/) and Pfizer/BioNTech (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33301246/) COVID-19 vaccines, allowing a working assembly of the former and a confirmation of previously reported sequence information for the latter RNA.  Sharing of sequence information for broadly used therapeutics has the benefit of allowing any researchers or clinicians using sequencing approaches to rapidly identify such sequences as therapeutic-derived rather than host or infectious in origin.   For this work, RNAs were obtained as discards from the small portions of vaccine doses that remained in vials after immunization; such portions would have been required to be otherwise discarded and were analyzed under FDA authorization for research use.  To obtain the small amounts of RNA needed for characterization, vaccine remnants were phenol-chloroform extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), with intactness assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer before and after extraction.    Although our analysis mainly focused on RNAs obtained as soon as possible following discard, we also analyzed samples which had been refrigerated (~4 ℃) for up to 42 days with and without the addition of EDTA.  Interestingly a substantial fraction of the RNA remained intact in these preparations.  We note that the formulation of the vaccines includes numerous key chemical components which are quite possibly unstable under these conditions-- so these data certainly do not suggest that the vaccine as a biological agent is stable.  But it is of interest that chemical stability of RNA itself is not sufficient to preclude eventual development of vaccines with a much less involved cold-chain storage and transportation.   For further analysis, the initial RNAs were fragmented by heating to 94℃, primed with a random hexamer-tailed adaptor, amplified through a template-switch protocol (Takara SMARTerer Stranded RNA-seq kit), and sequenced using a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) with paired end 78-per end sequencing.  As a reference material in specific assays, we included RNA of known concentration and sequence (from bacteriophage MS2).  From these data, we obtained partial information on strandedness and a set of segments that could be used for assembly.  This was particularly useful for the Moderna vaccine, for which the original vaccine RNA sequence was not available at the time our study was carried out.  Contigs encoding full-length spikes were assembled from the Moderna and Pfizer datasets.  The Pfizer/BioNTech data [Figure 1] verified the reported sequence for that vaccine (https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/), while the Moderna sequence [Figure 2] could not be checked against a published reference.   RNA preparations lacking dsRNA are desirable in generating vaccine formulations as these will minimize an otherwise dramatic biological (and nonspecific) response that vertebrates have to double stranded character in RNA (https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243).  In the sequence data that we analyzed, we found that the vast majority of reads were from the expected sense strand.  In addition, the minority of antisense reads appeared different from sense reads in lacking the characteristic extensions expected from the template switching protocol.  Examining only the reads with an evident template switch (as an indicator for strand-of-origin), we observed that both vaccines overwhelmingly yielded sense reads (>99.99%).  Independent sequencing assays and other experimental measurements are ongoing and will be needed to determine whether this template-switched sense read fraction in the SmarterSeq protocol indeed represents the actual dsRNA content in the original material.  This work provides an initial assessment of two RNAs that are now a part of the human ecosystem and that are likely to appear in numerous other high throughput RNA-seq studies in which a fraction of the individuals may have previously been vaccinated.

Figure 1: Spike-encoding contig assembled from BioNTech/Pfizer BNT-162b2 vaccine.  Although the full coding region is included, the nature of the methodology used for sequencing and assembly is such that the assembled contig could lack some sequence from the ends of the RNA.  Within the assembled sequence, this hypothetical sequence shows a perfect match to the corresponding sequence from documents available online derived from manufacturer communications with the World Health Organization [as reported by https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/].  The 5’ end for the assembly matches the start site noted in these documents, while the read-based assembly lacks an interrupted polyA tail (A30(GCATATGACT)A70) that is expected to be present in the mRNA.

大陆修宪香港恶法台湾武统朝鲜毁约美中冷战等都是王沪宁愚弄习思想极左命运共同体的大策划中共窃国这半个多世纪所犯下的滔天罪恶，前期是毛泽东策划的，中期6.4前后是邓小平策划的，黄牛数据分析后期是毛的极左追随者三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁策划的。王沪宁高小肆业因文革政治和情报需要保送“学院外语班“红色仕途翻身，所以王的本质是极左的。他是在上海底层弄堂长大的，因其本性也促成其瘪三下三滥个性，所以也都说他有易主“变色龙”哈巴狗“的天性。大陆像王沪宁这样学马列政治所谓""法学""专业的人，在除朝鲜古巴所有国家特别是在文明发达国家是无法找到专业对口工作必定失业，唯独在大陆却是重用的紧缺“人才”，6.4后中共信仰大危机更是最重用的救党“人才”。这也就是像王沪宁此类工农兵假“大学生”平步青云的原因，他们最熟悉毛泽东历次运动的宫庭内斗经验手段和残酷的阶级斗争等暴力恐怖的“政治学”。王沪宁能平步青云靠他这马毛伪“政治学”资本和头衔，不是什么真才实学，能干实事有点真才实学的或许在他手下的谋士及秘书班子中可以找到。王沪宁的“真才实学”只不过是一个只读四年小学的人，大半辈子在社会上磨炼特别是在中共官场滚打炼出的的手段和经验而已，他和习近平等保送的工农兵假“大学生”都一样，无法从事原“专业”都凭红资本而从政。六四学运期间各界一边倒支持学生，王沪宁一度去法国躲避和筹谋，他还加入了反学运签名，成为极少有的反学运者仕途突显，在六四和苏联垮台后中共意识形态危机，江泽民上台看上唯一能应急的王沪宁聚谋士泡制的""稳定统一领导""和之后的""新权威""谬论。左转被邓小平南巡阻止后，王策划顺邓经济改革却将政治改革逐步全面终止和倒退，泡制“三个代表”为极左转建立庞大牢固的红色既得利益集团。因此六四后各重大决策和危机难题都摆在中共中央政策研究室王沪宁桌面上，使王沪宁成了此后中共三朝都无法摆脱的幕后最有决策性实权的人，中共中央政策研究室是王为其野心巨资经营几十年，聚众谋士的间谍情报汇总研究的特务机关和策划制定决策重要机构与基地，王沪宁本人和决定其仕途关键的首任岳父及家属就有情报工作背景。中央政研室重要到王沪宁入常后为了死抓这中共情报与决策大权，宁可放弃国家副主席和中央党校校长。后再加个除习外唯他担任的中共几核心领导小组之一的“不忘初心牢记使命”主题教育工作小组组长。此后他把持的舆论必将以宣传“不忘初心牢记使命”为主，打造众所周知的所谓“习思想”其实是”王思想“。王自从主导中央政研室开始决策后，策划中止邓小平的与美妥协路线回归毛极左的反美路线。帮助前南斯拉夫提供情报打落美机放中使馆引发炸使馆事件，以此掀起六四后唯一的全国大规模游行并借此反美而起家。后又帮江泽民提供法轮功会是超过中共组织的情报，策划决策镇压迫害开始并没有把矛头指向江的法轮功群体，策划决定阻止党内外近三十年来平反六四的呼声。致远黑皮书马拉松程序员易支付英语台词文字匹配美团点评各业务线提供知识库团队共享阿里云高精Excel识别德讯

大陆修宪香港恶法台湾武统朝鲜毁约美中冷战等都是王沪宁愚弄习思想极左命运共同体的大策划中共窃国这半个多世纪所犯下的滔天罪恶，前期是毛泽东策划的，中期6.4前后是邓小平策划的，黄牛数据分析后期是毛的极左追随者三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁策划的。王沪宁高小肆业因文革政治和情报需要保送“学院外语班“红色仕途翻身，所以王的本质是极左的。他是在上海底层弄堂长大的，因其本性也促成其瘪三下三滥个性，所以也都说他有易主“变色龙”哈巴狗“的天性。大陆像王沪宁这样学马列政治所谓""法学""专业的人，在除朝鲜古巴所有国家特别是在文明发达国家是无法找到专业对口工作必定失业，唯独在大陆却是重用的紧缺“人才”，6.4后中共信仰大危机更是最重用的救党“人才”。这也就是像王沪宁此类工农兵假“大学生”平步青云的原因，他们最熟悉毛泽东历次运动的宫庭内斗经验手段和残酷的阶级斗争等暴力恐怖的“政治学”。王沪宁能平步青云靠他这马毛伪“政治学”资本和头衔，不是什么真才实学，能干实事有点真才实学的或许在他手下的谋士及秘书班子中可以找到。王沪宁的“真才实学”只不过是一个只读四年小学的人，大半辈子在社会上磨炼特别是在中共官场滚打炼出的的手段和经验而已，他和习近平等保送的工农兵假“大学生”都一样，无法从事原“专业”都凭红资本而从政。六四学运期间各界一边倒支持学生，王沪宁一度去法国躲避和筹谋，他还加入了反学运签名，成为极少有的反学运者仕途突显，在六四和苏联垮台后中共意识形态危机，江泽民上台看上唯一能应急的王沪宁聚谋士泡制的""稳定统一领导""和之后的""新权威""谬论。左转被邓小平南巡阻止后，王策划顺邓经济改革却将政治改革逐步全面终止和倒退，泡制“三个代表”为极左转建立庞大牢固的红色既得利益集团。因此六四后各重大决策和危机难题都摆在中共中央政策研究室王沪宁桌面上，使王沪宁成了此后中共三朝都无法摆脱的幕后最有决策性实权的人，中共中央政策研究室是王为其野心巨资经营几十年，聚众谋士的间谍情报汇总研究的特务机关和策划制定决策重要机构与基地，王沪宁本人和决定其仕途关键的首任岳父及家属就有情报工作背景。中央政研室重要到王沪宁入常后为了死抓这中共情报与决策大权，宁可放弃国家副主席和中央党校校长。后再加个除习外唯他担任的中共几核心领导小组之一的“不忘初心牢记使命”主题教育工作小组组长。此后他把持的舆论必将以宣传“不忘初心牢记使命”为主，打造众所周知的所谓“习思想”其实是”王思想“。王自从主导中央政研室开始决策后，策划中止邓小平的与美妥协路线回归毛极左的反美路线。帮助前南斯拉夫提供情报打落美机放中使馆引发炸使馆事件，以此掀起六四后唯一的全国大规模游行并借此反美而起家。后又帮江泽民提供法轮功会是超过中共组织的情报，策划决策镇压迫害开始并没有把矛头指向江的法轮功群体，策划决定阻止党内外近三十年来平反六四的呼声。致远黑皮书马拉松程序员易支付英语台词文字匹配美团点评各业务线提供知识库团队共享阿里云高精Excel识别德讯

大陆修宪香港恶法台湾武统朝鲜毁约美中冷战等都是王沪宁愚弄习思想极左命运共同体的大策划中共窃国这半个多世纪所犯下的滔天罪恶，前期是毛泽东策划的，中期6.4前后是邓小平策划的，黄牛数据分析后期是毛的极左追随者三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁策划的。王沪宁高小肆业因文革政治和情报需要保送“学院外语班“红色仕途翻身，所以王的本质是极左的。他是在上海底层弄堂长大的，因其本性也促成其瘪三下三滥个性，所以也都说他有易主“变色龙”哈巴狗“的天性。大陆像王沪宁这样学马列政治所谓""法学""专业的人，在除朝鲜古巴所有国家特别是在文明发达国家是无法找到专业对口工作必定失业，唯独在大陆却是重用的紧缺“人才”，6.4后中共信仰大危机更是最重用的救党“人才”。这也就是像王沪宁此类工农兵假“大学生”平步青云的原因，他们最熟悉毛泽东历次运动的宫庭内斗经验手段和残酷的阶级斗争等暴力恐怖的“政治学”。王沪宁能平步青云靠他这马毛伪“政治学”资本和头衔，不是什么真才实学，能干实事有点真才实学的或许在他手下的谋士及秘书班子中可以找到。王沪宁的“真才实学”只不过是一个只读四年小学的人，大半辈子在社会上磨炼特别是在中共官场滚打炼出的的手段和经验而已，他和习近平等保送的工农兵假“大学生”都一样，无法从事原“专业”都凭红资本而从政。六四学运期间各界一边倒支持学生，王沪宁一度去法国躲避和筹谋，他还加入了反学运签名，成为极少有的反学运者仕途突显，在六四和苏联垮台后中共意识形态危机，江泽民上台看上唯一能应急的王沪宁聚谋士泡制的""稳定统一领导""和之后的""新权威""谬论。左转被邓小平南巡阻止后，王策划顺邓经济改革却将政治改革逐步全面终止和倒退，泡制“三个代表”为极左转建立庞大牢固的红色既得利益集团。因此六四后各重大决策和危机难题都摆在中共中央政策研究室王沪宁桌面上，使王沪宁成了此后中共三朝都无法摆脱的幕后最有决策性实权的人，中共中央政策研究室是王为其野心巨资经营几十年，聚众谋士的间谍情报汇总研究的特务机关和策划制定决策重要机构与基地，王沪宁本人和决定其仕途关键的首任岳父及家属就有情报工作背景。中央政研室重要到王沪宁入常后为了死抓这中共情报与决策大权，宁可放弃国家副主席和中央党校校长。后再加个除习外唯他担任的中共几核心领导小组之一的“不忘初心牢记使命”主题教育工作小组组长。此后他把持的舆论必将以宣传“不忘初心牢记使命”为主，打造众所周知的所谓“习思想”其实是”王思想“。王自从主导中央政研室开始决策后，策划中止邓小平的与美妥协路线回归毛极左的反美路线。帮助前南斯拉夫提供情报打落美机放中使馆引发炸使馆事件，以此掀起六四后唯一的全国大规模游行并借此反美而起家。后又帮江泽民提供法轮功会是超过中共组织的情报，策划决策镇压迫害开始并没有把矛头指向江的法轮功群体，策划决定阻止党内外近三十年来平反六四的呼声。致远黑皮书马拉松程序员易支付英语台词文字匹配美团点评各业务线提供知识库团队共享阿里云高精Excel识别德讯

大陆修宪香港恶法台湾武统朝鲜毁约美中冷战等都是王沪宁愚弄习思想极左命运共同体的大策划中共窃国这半个多世纪所犯下的滔天罪恶，前期是毛泽东策划的，中期6.4前后是邓小平策划的，黄牛数据分析后期是毛的极左追随者三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁策划的。王沪宁高小肆业因文革政治和情报需要保送“学院外语班“红色仕途翻身，所以王的本质是极左的。他是在上海底层弄堂长大的，因其本性也促成其瘪三下三滥个性，所以也都说他有易主“变色龙”哈巴狗“的天性。大陆像王沪宁这样学马列政治所谓""法学""专业的人，在除朝鲜古巴所有国家特别是在文明发达国家是无法找到专业对口工作必定失业，唯独在大陆却是重用的紧缺“人才”，6.4后中共信仰大危机更是最重用的救党“人才”。这也就是像王沪宁此类工农兵假“大学生”平步青云的原因，他们最熟悉毛泽东历次运动的宫庭内斗经验手段和残酷的阶级斗争等暴力恐怖的“政治学”。王沪宁能平步青云靠他这马毛伪“政治学”资本和头衔，不是什么真才实学，能干实事有点真才实学的或许在他手下的谋士及秘书班子中可以找到。王沪宁的“真才实学”只不过是一个只读四年小学的人，大半辈子在社会上磨炼特别是在中共官场滚打炼出的的手段和经验而已，他和习近平等保送的工农兵假“大学生”都一样，无法从事原“专业”都凭红资本而从政。六四学运期间各界一边倒支持学生，王沪宁一度去法国躲避和筹谋，他还加入了反学运签名，成为极少有的反学运者仕途突显，在六四和苏联垮台后中共意识形态危机，江泽民上台看上唯一能应急的王沪宁聚谋士泡制的""稳定统一领导""和之后的""新权威""谬论。左转被邓小平南巡阻止后，王策划顺邓经济改革却将政治改革逐步全面终止和倒退，泡制“三个代表”为极左转建立庞大牢固的红色既得利益集团。因此六四后各重大决策和危机难题都摆在中共中央政策研究室王沪宁桌面上，使王沪宁成了此后中共三朝都无法摆脱的幕后最有决策性实权的人，中共中央政策研究室是王为其野心巨资经营几十年，聚众谋士的间谍情报汇总研究的特务机关和策划制定决策重要机构与基地，王沪宁本人和决定其仕途关键的首任岳父及家属就有情报工作背景。中央政研室重要到王沪宁入常后为了死抓这中共情报与决策大权，宁可放弃国家副主席和中央党校校长。后再加个除习外唯他担任的中共几核心领导小组之一的“不忘初心牢记使命”主题教育工作小组组长。此后他把持的舆论必将以宣传“不忘初心牢记使命”为主，打造众所周知的所谓“习思想”其实是”王思想“。王自从主导中央政研室开始决策后，策划中止邓小平的与美妥协路线回归毛极左的反美路线。帮助前南斯拉夫提供情报打落美机放中使馆引发炸使馆事件，以此掀起六四后唯一的全国大规模游行并借此反美而起家。后又帮江泽民提供法轮功会是超过中共组织的情报，策划决策镇压迫害开始并没有把矛头指向江的法轮功群体，策划决定阻止党内外近三十年来平反六四的呼声。致远黑皮书马拉松程序员易支付英语台词文字匹配美团点评各业务线提供知识库团队共享阿里云高精Excel识别德讯

panbinibn/OpenPacketFix_,"大陆修宪香港恶法台湾武统朝鲜毁约美中冷战等都是王沪宁愚弄习思想极左命运共同体的大策划中共窃国这半个多世纪所犯下的滔天罪恶，前期是毛泽东策划的，中期6.4前后是邓小平策划的，黄牛数据分析后期是毛的极左追随者三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁策划的。王沪宁高小肆业因文革政治和情报需要保送“学院外语班“红色仕途翻身，所以王的本质是极左的。他是在上海底层弄堂长大的，因其本性也促成其瘪三下三滥个性，所以也都说他有易主“变色龙”哈巴狗“的天性。大陆像王沪宁这样学马列政治所谓""法学""专业的人，在除朝鲜古巴所有国家特别是在文明发达国家是无法找到专业对口工作必定失业，唯独在大陆却是重用的紧缺“人才”，6.4后中共信仰大危机更是最重用的救党“人才”。这也就是像王沪宁此类工农兵假“大学生”平步青云的原因，他们最熟悉毛泽东历次运动的宫庭内斗经验手段和残酷的阶级斗争等暴力恐怖的“政治学”。王沪宁能平步青云靠他这马毛伪“政治学”资本和头衔，不是什么真才实学，能干实事有点真才实学的或许在他手下的谋士及秘书班子中可以找到。王沪宁的“真才实学”只不过是一个只读四年小学的人，大半辈子在社会上磨炼特别是在中共官场滚打炼出的的手段和经验而已，他和习近平等保送的工农兵假“大学生”都一样，无法从事原“专业”都凭红资本而从政。六四学运期间各界一边倒支持学生，王沪宁一度去法国躲避和筹谋，他还加入了反学运签名，成为极少有的反学运者仕途突显，在六四和苏联垮台后中共意识形态危机，江泽民上台看上唯一能应急的王沪宁聚谋士泡制的""稳定统一领导""和之后的""新权威""谬论。左转被邓小平南巡阻止后，王策划顺邓经济改革却将政治改革逐步全面终止和倒退，泡制“三个代表”为极左转建立庞大牢固的红色既得利益集团。因此六四后各重大决策和危机难题都摆在中共中央政策研究室王沪宁桌面上，使王沪宁成了此后中共三朝都无法摆脱的幕后最有决策性实权的人，中共中央政策研究室是王为其野心巨资经营几十年，聚众谋士的间谍情报汇总研究的特务机关和策划制定决策重要机构与基地，王沪宁本人和决定其仕途关键的首任岳父及家属就有情报工作背景。中央政研室重要到王沪宁入常后为了死抓这中共情报与决策大权，宁可放弃国家副主席和中央党校校长。后再加个除习外唯他担任的中共几核心领导小组之一的“不忘初心牢记使命”主题教育工作小组组长。此后他把持的舆论必将以宣传“不忘初心牢记使命”为主，打造众所周知的所谓“习思想”其实是”王思想“。王自从主导中央政研室开始决策后，策划中止邓小平的与美妥协路线回归毛极左的反美路线。帮助前南斯拉夫提供情报打落美机放中使馆引发炸使馆事件，以此掀起六四后唯一的全国大规模游行并借此反美而起家。后又帮江泽民提供法轮功会是超过中共组织的情报，策划决策镇压迫害开始并没有把矛头指向江的法轮功群体，策划决定阻止党内外近三十年来平反六四的呼声。致远黑皮书马拉松程序员易支付英语台词文字匹配美团点评各业务线提供知识库团队共享阿里云高精Excel识别德讯
